# Oscilace řady (Series Oscillation)

## Summary
A series oscillates if its sequence of partial sums has no limit.

## Detailed Explanation
An infinite numerical series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ is said to **oscillate** if its sequence of partial sums, $(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty$, does not approach any limit, neither a finite number nor positive or negative infinity. Instead, the partial sums fluctuate indefinitely without settling on a particular value or tending towards infinity.

For an oscillating series, the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty} s_n$ simply *does not exist*. An example of an oscillating series is the Grandi's series, $\sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \dots$, where the partial sums alternate between 1 and 0.

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is of **moderate importance** (score: 0.7) as it describes a specific type of non-convergent series behavior distinct from divergence to infinity. Recognizing oscillation is crucial for a complete understanding of series behavior and for correctly applying (or refraining from applying) methods that assume convergence or standard divergence.
