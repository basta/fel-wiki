# omezená (Bounded)

## Summary
A set M is bounded if it is both bounded above (shora omezená) and bounded below (zdola omezená).

## Detailed Explanation
A set M is defined as bounded if it satisfies two conditions simultaneously:
*   It is **bounded above (shora omezená)**: This means there exists some real number (an upper bound) that is greater than or equal to every element in the set.
*   It is **bounded below (zdola omezená)**: This means there exists some real number (a lower bound) that is less than or equal to every element in the set.
