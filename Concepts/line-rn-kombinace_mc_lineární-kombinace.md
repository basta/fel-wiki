# Lineární kombinace

## Summary
A linear combination of vectors $x_1, \dots, x_n$ with scalars $a_1, \dots, a_n$ is an expression of the form $a_1 \cdot x_1 + \dots + a_n \cdot x_n$.

## Detailed Explanation
A linear combination is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that combines vectors using scalar multiplication and vector addition. It represents any vector that can be reached by scaling and summing a given set of vectors.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (from Lecture "Lineární závislost a nezávislost"):** "A linear combination of vectors $x_1, \dots, x_n$ with scalars $a_1, \dots, a_n$ is an expression of the form $a_1 \cdot x_1 + \dots + a_n \cdot x_n$."

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is highly important (Importance Score: 0.9) as it forms the basis for many other core concepts in linear algebra, including linear span, linear dependence/independence, and vector subspaces.
