# Jádro (ker(f))

## Summary
The kernel of a linear transformation f: L1 -> L2 is the set of all vectors x in L1 such that f(x) = 0, i.e., ker(f) = {x | f(x) = 0}. It is a subspace of L1.

## Detailed Explanation
*   The kernel of a linear transformation f: L1 -> L2 is the set of all vectors x in L1 such that f(x) = 0, i.e., ker(f) = {x | f(x) = 0}. It is a subspace of L1. (Source: 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2)
