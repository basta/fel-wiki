# Lineární homogenní rekurentní rovnice

## Summary
An equation that defines a sequence where each term is a linear combination of previous terms, e.g., F(n+k) = a1F(n+k-1) + ... + akF(n). These can often be solved using matrix diagonalization.

## Detailed Explanation
A Lineární homogenní rekurentní rovnice (Linear Homogeneous Recurrence Relation) is an equation that defines a sequence in which each term, beyond a certain point, is expressed as a linear combination of a fixed number of preceding terms. A general form for such an equation is:
$$ F(n+k) = a_1F(n+k-1) + a_2F(n+k-2) + \dots + a_kF(n) $$
where $a_1, \dots, a_k$ are constant coefficients. These equations are "homogeneous" because there is no constant term independent of $F(n)$, and "linear" because $F$ terms are not multiplied together or raised to powers. A common example is the Fibonacci sequence. A powerful technique for solving these types of recurrence relations, especially for finding a direct formula for $F(n)$, involves using matrix diagonalization.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (score: 0.8) as it provides a framework for modeling discrete systems and sequences in various fields, including computer science (algorithm analysis), mathematics (combinatorics), and finance. The connection to matrix diagonalization makes it a significant application of linear algebra.
