# Reflexe (Reflection)

## Summary
A special case of a linear transformation that mirrors a vector across an axis. For example, reflection across the x-axis (negating the y-component) is represented by [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

## Detailed Explanation
According to definition from lecture "Lineární zobrazení" (ID: lec_3a1d5599-e40d-4042-832d-d69b45499fe2):
A special case of a linear transformation that mirrors a vector across an axis. For example, reflection across the x-axis (negating the y-component) is represented by $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.
