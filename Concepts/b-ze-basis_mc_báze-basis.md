# Báze (Basis)

## Summary
A set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space, allowing any vector in the space to be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors.

## Detailed Explanation
A **Basis** for a vector space is a crucial concept that allows us to define coordinates for vectors within that space. It is a specific set of vectors that meets two important criteria:

According to definition:
*   "A set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space, allowing any vector in the space to be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors." (Source: lec-coordinate-transformation-matrices-05B-2024)

Breaking down the definition:
1.  **Linearly Independent:** No vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the other vectors in the set. This ensures that there are no redundant vectors.
2.  **Span the Vector Space:** Every vector in the vector space can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis set. This means the basis vectors are sufficient to "reach" any point in the space.

Together, these two properties guarantee that every vector in the space can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The number of vectors in a basis for a given vector space is always the same, and this number is called the dimension of the vector space.

## Importance/Relevance
This is a very important and fundamental concept (score 0.85) in linear algebra, providing the framework for understanding vector spaces, defining dimension, and allowing for the coordinate representation of vectors.
