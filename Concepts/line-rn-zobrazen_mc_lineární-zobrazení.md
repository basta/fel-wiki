## Summary
A function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication, often represented by matrices.

## Detailed Explanation
A linear transformation is a special type of function between two vector spaces that maintains the algebraic structure of these spaces. Specifically, it respects two fundamental operations:

*   **Vector Addition:** The transformation of a sum of two vectors is equal to the sum of their individual transformations. That is, $L(u + v) = L(u) + L(v)$.
*   **Scalar Multiplication:** The transformation of a scalar multiple of a vector is equal to the scalar multiple of the transformation of the vector. That is, $L(c \cdot u) = c \cdot L(u)$.

Linear transformations are often represented by matrices, which simplifies their application and analysis, especially in canonical bases.
