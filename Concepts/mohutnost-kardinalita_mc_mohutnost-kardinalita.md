# Mohutnost (kardinalita)

## Summary
Sets A and B have the same cardinality (mohustnost) if there exists a bijection from A to B.

## Detailed Explanation
Cardinality is a fundamental concept in set theory that allows us to compare the "size" of sets, even infinite ones. It formalizes the intuitive idea of counting.

**Definition:**
*   Sets A and B have the same cardinality (mohustnost) if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one and onto mapping) from A to B.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.6, cardinality is a cornerstone of set theory and mathematical logic. It enables the classification of infinite sets (e.g., countable vs. uncountable) and has broad implications across various fields of mathematics.
