# Nulov√° matice

## Summary
A matrix where all entries are zero. In a linear space Lin(Fs, Fr), it is denoted Os,r.

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition
A **Null Matrix** is defined as a matrix where every single entry (element) is zero.

*   **Source:** 04B-2024-Algebra-Matic: "A matrix where all entries are zero. In a linear space Lin(Fs, Fr), it is denoted Os,r."

In the context of a linear space, specifically `Lin(Fs, Fr)`, which represents the set of all `s x r` matrices with entries from a field `F`, the null matrix is often denoted as `Os,r`.

## Importance/Relevance
With an `overallImportanceScore` of 0.7, the Null Matrix is a moderately important concept. It serves as the additive identity in matrix addition, analogous to the number zero in scalar arithmetic.
