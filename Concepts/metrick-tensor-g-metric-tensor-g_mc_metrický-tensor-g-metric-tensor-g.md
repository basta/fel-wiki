# Metrický tensor G (Metric Tensor G)

## Summary
A tensor used to define a scalar product in $R^n$ as $<x | y> = x^\top G y$. For the standard scalar product, $G$ is the identity matrix ($E_n$).

## Detailed Explanation
The Metric Tensor G is a fundamental mathematical object used to define a scalar product in $R^n$. Specifically, it allows for the scalar product of two vectors $x$ and $y$ to be expressed as $<x | y> = x^\top G y$. This generalizes the standard Euclidean dot product.

For the standard scalar product (Euclidean dot product), the metric tensor $G$ simplifies to the identity matrix ($E_n$). This means that in Euclidean space, $x^\top E_n y = x^\top y$, which is the standard dot product.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, the Metric Tensor G is a significant concept in linear algebra and differential geometry, as it provides a way to define inner products and generalize geometric concepts beyond standard Euclidean space.
