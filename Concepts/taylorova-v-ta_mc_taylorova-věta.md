## Summary
If a function $f$ has continuous derivatives up to order $n \ge 0$ on $(a, x)$ and $f^{(n+1)}$ exists in every point of $(a, x)$, then there exists a $c \in (a, x)$ such that $f(x)$ can be expressed as a Taylor polynomial of order $n$ plus a remainder term in Lagrange form.

## Detailed Explanation
Taylor's Theorem is a cornerstone of calculus, providing a way to approximate a differentiable function with a polynomial (the Taylor polynomial). Crucially, it also provides a precise form for the remainder (or error) of this approximation, often in what's known as Lagrange form.

**Definition:**
*   If a function $f$ has continuous derivatives up to order $n \ge 0$ on $(a, x)$ and $f^{(n+1)}$ exists in every point of $(a, x)$, then there exists a $c \in (a, x)$ such that $f(x)$ can be expressed as a Taylor polynomial of order $n$ plus a remainder term in Lagrange form.

## Importance/Relevance
Taylor's Theorem is highly important (score: 0.9/1.0) because it provides the theoretical foundation for Taylor series, which are used extensively for approximating functions, solving differential equations, and analyzing the behavior of functions in the vicinity of a point. It's a key tool in numerical analysis and applied mathematics.
