# L'Hospitalovo pravidlo (L'Hôpital's Rule)

## Summary
A method to evaluate indeterminate forms of limits by taking the derivatives of the numerator and denominator.

## Detailed Explanation
L'Hôpital's Rule is a powerful technique in calculus used to resolve indeterminate forms that arise when evaluating limits. These forms typically include $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. The rule provides a way to simplify such limits by using derivatives.

**Definition:**
*   A method to evaluate indeterminate forms of limits by taking the derivatives of the numerator and denominator.
