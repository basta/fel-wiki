# Singulární matice

## Summary
A square matrix A: Fn -> Fn is singular if it is not regular.

## Detailed Explanation
A square matrix $A: F^n \rightarrow F^n$ is defined as **singular** if it is not regular. This means that a singular matrix does not have an inverse matrix.
This definition comes from the lecture "Lineární zobrazení, část 2" (ID: 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2).

## Key Aspects/Components
(No specific key aspects provided in the data.)

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an importance score of 0.6 out of 1.0. While less central than regular matrices, understanding singular matrices is crucial as they represent linear transformations that are not invertible, often implying a loss of dimension or information.
