# Lokální minimum (maximum)

## Summary
A function f has a local minimum (maximum) at point 'a' if f(x) ≥ f(a) (f(x) ≤ f(a)) in some punctured neighborhood of 'a'.

## Detailed Explanation
* A function $f$ has a local minimum (maximum) at point '$a$' if $f(x) \geq f(a)$ ($f(x) \leq f(a)$) in some punctured neighborhood of '$a$'. (Source: Calculus: Derivatives, Functions, Sequences, and Integrals)
