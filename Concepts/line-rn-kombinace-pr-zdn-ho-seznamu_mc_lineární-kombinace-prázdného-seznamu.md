# Lineární kombinace prázdného seznamu

## Summary
The linear combination of an empty list of vectors is the zero vector.

## Detailed Explanation
A linear combination typically involves scaling vectors by scalars and then adding them. When the list of vectors is empty, there are no vectors to scale and add. By convention, and to maintain consistency with vector space axioms (specifically the existence of an additive identity), the result of such an "empty sum" or "empty linear combination" is defined as the zero vector. This convention is crucial for certain proofs and definitions, such as the definition of the linear span of an empty set being the zero vector space.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from Lecture "Lineární obal a lineární podprostor" (ID: lec_405d2298-d6a0-4f9e-aa9f-6ca3f176cd57):**
    "je nulový vektor."

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has a moderate importance score (0.5). While seemingly trivial, it's a fundamental convention in linear algebra that ensures mathematical consistency, particularly when dealing with empty sets or basis vectors. It plays a role in defining the linear span of an empty set.
