# Intervals

## Summary
Sets of real numbers between two endpoints a and b, which can be open, closed, or half-open/closed.

## Detailed Explanation
In mathematics, an interval is a set of real numbers that contains all real numbers lying between any two numbers of the set. This includes the possibility of including or excluding the endpoints themselves.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** "Sets of real numbers between two endpoints a and b, which can be open, closed, or half-open/closed."

Intervals are typically denoted using brackets and parentheses to indicate whether endpoints are included.
*   **Open Interval:** $(a, b)$ - includes all numbers between $a$ and $b$, but not $a$ or $b$.
*   **Closed Interval:** $[a, b]$ - includes all numbers between $a$ and $b$, including $a$ and $b$.
*   **Half-Open/Closed Intervals:** $[a, b)$ or $(a, b]$ - include one endpoint but exclude the other.
*   **Infinite Intervals:** Can extend to $-\infty$ or $+\infty$, e.g., $(a, \infty)$ or $(-\infty, b]$.

## Importance/Relevance
Intervals are moderately important (Importance Score: 0.7) foundational concepts in calculus and analysis, used to define domains of functions, solution sets of inequalities, and continuity properties.
