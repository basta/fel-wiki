# Infimum (Greatest Lower Bound)

## Summary
The largest lower bound of a set M.

## Detailed Explanation
The **Infimum** of a set $M$, often denoted as $\inf(M)$, is defined as the largest among all its lower bounds. For a set to have an infimum, it must first be bounded below. If it is bounded below, then the infimum is a unique real number that satisfies two conditions:
1.  It is a lower bound of $M$.
2.  No number larger than the infimum is a lower bound of $M$.
