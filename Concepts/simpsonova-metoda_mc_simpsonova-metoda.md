# Simpsonova metoda

## Summary
A numerical integration method that approximates the area under a curve by integrating parabolic interpolation over pairs of subintervals.

## Detailed Explanation
Simpson's Rule is a numerical integration method that offers a higher degree of accuracy than the Trapezoidal Rule. Its core principle is to approximate the area under a curve by integrating parabolic interpolation over pairs of subintervals. Instead of using straight lines to connect points, Simpson's Rule fits a parabolic arc through three points (the two endpoints of a pair of subintervals and the midpoint). By using a quadratic approximation, it typically yields a more precise estimate of the definite integral, especially for functions that are smooth over the integration interval. This method generally requires the number of subintervals to be even.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an importance score of 0.7. Simpson's Rule is highly important in numerical analysis due to its improved accuracy compared to simpler methods, making it a widely used technique for more precise approximations of definite integrals in scientific and engineering applications.
