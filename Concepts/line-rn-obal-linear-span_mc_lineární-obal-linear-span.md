# Lineární obal (Linear Span)

## Summary
The set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors, forming a subspace. Essential for the definition of a generating set and basis.

## Detailed Explanation
The linear span of a set of vectors is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. It describes the smallest subspace that contains all the vectors in the set. Any vector within this subspace can be expressed as a linear combination of the original vectors.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (from Lecture "Báze a dimense"):** "The set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors, forming a subspace. Essential for the definition of a generating set and basis."

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is moderately important (Importance Score: 0.7) as it is essential for defining generating sets and bases, which are central to understanding vector spaces.
