# Direktní rozklad

## Summary
A decomposition of a vector space (e.g., R³) into a direct sum of subspaces, meaning the union spans the space and their intersection is only the zero vector. Can also apply to linear transformations.

## Detailed Explanation
Direktní rozklad, or direct decomposition, refers to the process of breaking down a vector space into a collection of subspaces such that the original space is the direct sum of these subspaces. This implies two crucial conditions:
1.  The union of these subspaces spans the entire vector space.
2.  The intersection of any two distinct subspaces is only the zero vector.

This concept is fundamental not only for vector spaces but also extends to linear transformations, where it can be used to simplify the analysis of complex transformations by breaking them into simpler parts acting on these direct sum components.

**Definition:**
*   A decomposition of a vector space (e.g., R³) into a direct sum of subspaces, meaning the union spans the space and their intersection is only the zero vector. Can also apply to linear transformations. (Source: Lecture "Jordanův tvar")
