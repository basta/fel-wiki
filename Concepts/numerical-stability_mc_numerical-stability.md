# Numerical Stability

## Summary
A property of an algorithm concerning how errors in input data or intermediate calculations propagate. An algorithm is numerically unstable if errors amplify significantly, leading to inaccurate results.

## Detailed Explanation
Numerical stability is a crucial property, especially in computational mathematics and numerical analysis. It addresses how errors, whether from initial input data or those introduced during intermediate calculations (e.g., due to floating-point precision), are handled by an algorithm.

*   A numerically stable algorithm ensures that these errors do not grow disproportionately large, preserving the accuracy of the final result.
*   Conversely, a numerically unstable algorithm will lead to a significant amplification of errors, rendering the computed solution unreliable or completely inaccurate.

**Definition:**
*   A property of an algorithm concerning how errors in input data or intermediate calculations propagate. An algorithm is numerically unstable if errors amplify significantly, leading to inaccurate results. (Source: 06B-2024-GEM-souostavy-cast2)
