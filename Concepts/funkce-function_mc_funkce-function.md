# Funkce (Function)

## Summary
A mapping from a non-empty set A (domain, D(f)) to the set of real numbers R, where each element in A is assigned exactly one element in R (range, R(f)).

## Detailed Explanation
A **function**, denoted as $f: A \to R$, is a special type of relation between two sets. Specifically, it is a mapping from a non-empty set $A$, called the **domain** (often denoted as $D(f)$), to the set of real numbers $R$. The key characteristic of a function is that every element in the domain $A$ is assigned to *exactly one* element in the set $R$. The set of all actual output values in $R$ that the function produces is called the **range** (often denoted as $R(f)$).
