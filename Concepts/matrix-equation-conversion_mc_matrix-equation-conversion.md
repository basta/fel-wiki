# Matrix Equation Conversion

## Summary
The process of transforming a matrix equation of the form $A * X = B$ into multiple individual systems of linear equations ($A * x = b_i$, where $b_i$ are columns of $B$). The matrix equation has a solution if and only if all individual systems have solutions, which can then be assembled into $X$.

## Detailed Explanation
Matrix equation conversion is a method to simplify the solution of complex matrix equations. Instead of solving for an entire matrix variable $X$ at once, the problem is broken down into simpler, more manageable parts.

**Definition:**
The process of transforming a matrix equation of the form $A * X = B$ into multiple individual systems of linear equations ($A * x = b_i$, where $b_i$ are columns of $B$). The matrix equation has a solution if and only if all individual systems have solutions, which can then be assembled into $X$. (Source: 06B-2024-GEM-souostavy-cast2)

This conversion is particularly useful because solving $A * x = b_i$ for a vector $x$ is a standard problem that can be handled using techniques like Gaussian elimination. If each individual system has a solution, these solutions (which are vectors) can be combined to form the columns of the matrix $X$.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept holds high importance as it provides a practical methodology for solving matrix equations by leveraging established techniques for systems of linear equations. It simplifies what might otherwise be a more complex problem into a series of familiar steps.
