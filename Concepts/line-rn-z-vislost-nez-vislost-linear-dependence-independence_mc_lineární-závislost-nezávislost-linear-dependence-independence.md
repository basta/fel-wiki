# Lineární závislost/nezávislost (Linear Dependence/Independence)

## Summary
Concepts from previous lectures, crucial for the definition of a basis.

## Detailed Explanation
Linear dependence and independence are critical concepts that define the relationships between vectors in a vector space. They are particularly crucial for understanding and defining what constitutes a basis for a vector space.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (from Lecture "Báze a dimense"):** "Concepts from previous lectures, crucial for the definition of a basis."

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is moderately important (Importance Score: 0.7) as it is fundamental for defining a basis, a cornerstone concept in linear algebra.
