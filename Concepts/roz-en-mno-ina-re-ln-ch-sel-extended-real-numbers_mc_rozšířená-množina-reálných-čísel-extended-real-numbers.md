# rozšířená množina reálných čísel (Extended Real Numbers)

## Summary
The extended real numbers constitute the set of real numbers including positive and negative infinity, typically denoted by $\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$.

## Detailed Explanation
The set of real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, is often extended to include two idealized elements: positive infinity ($+\infty$) and negative infinity ($-\infty$). This new set is called the **extended real number line** or the **extended real numbers**.

The definition provided states:
"The set of real numbers including positive and negative infinity, denoted by $\overline{\mathbb{R}} = \mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

The purpose of extending the real numbers is to provide a framework for consistently handling concepts involving limits that approach infinity, such as the limit of a sequence or a function, or to define supremum and infimum for unbounded sets.

Key properties and conventions for extended real numbers:
*   For any real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$:
    *   $-\infty < x < +\infty$
    *   $x + \infty = +\infty$
    *   $x - \infty = -\infty$
    *   If $x > 0$, $x \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty$ and $x \cdot (-\infty) = -\infty$
    *   If $x < 0$, $x \cdot (+\infty) = -\infty$ and $x \cdot (-\infty) = +\infty$
    *   $\frac{x}{+\infty} = 0$ and $\frac{x}{-\infty} = 0$
*   Special cases (indeterminate forms):
    *   $\infty - \infty$
    *   $0 \cdot \infty$
    *   $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

These extended real numbers are particularly useful in measure theory, integration theory, and optimization problems.

## Importance/Relevance
The extended real numbers are highly important (score: 0.7) for providing a more complete and rigorous framework for analysis, allowing for cleaner statements and proofs of theorems involving limits and unbounded quantities without constant special casing.
