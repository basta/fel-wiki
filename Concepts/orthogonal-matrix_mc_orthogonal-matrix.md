# Orthogonal Matrix

## Summary
A square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors, meaning its transpose is equal to its inverse (Uᵀ=U⁻¹ and Vᵀ=V⁻¹).

## Detailed Explanation
**Definition (from svd-pseudoinverse-lecture):** A square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors, meaning its transpose is equal to its inverse (Uᵀ=U⁻¹ and Vᵀ=V⁻¹).

## Importance/Relevance
Orthogonal matrices are relevant in linear algebra due to their unique properties, such as preserving vector lengths and angles under transformation.
