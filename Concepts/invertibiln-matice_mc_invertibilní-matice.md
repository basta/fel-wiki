# Invertibiln√≠ matice

## Summary

A square matrix A is invertible if there exist matrices X and Y such that A.X = En and Y.A = En. The lecture demonstrates that even non-zero square matrices do not always guarantee invertibility.

## Detailed Explanation

### Definition
A square matrix A is invertible if there exist matrices X and Y such that A.X = En and Y.A = En. The lecture demonstrates that even non-zero square matrices do not always guarantee invertibility.
