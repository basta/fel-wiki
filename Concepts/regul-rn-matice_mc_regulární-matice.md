# Regulární matice

## Summary
A square matrix A: Fn -> Fn is regular (invertible, isomorphism) if there exists a unique inverse matrix A⁻¹ such that A⁻¹⋅A = En = A⋅A⁻¹.

## Detailed Explanation
A square matrix $A: F^n \rightarrow F^n$ is defined as **regular** if it possesses a unique inverse matrix, denoted as $A^{-1}$. This inverse matrix satisfies the following conditions:
$$ A^{-1} \cdot A = E_n = A \cdot A^{-1} $$
where $E_n$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix.
A regular matrix is also often referred to as an **invertible matrix** or representing an **isomorphism** (when considered as a linear transformation).
This definition comes from the lecture "Lineární zobrazení, část 2" (ID: 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2).
