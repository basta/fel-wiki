## Summary
The $k$-dimensional volume of a parallelepiped spanned by vectors ($a_1, \dots, a_k$) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the square root of the Gram determinant of these vectors, i.e., $\sqrt{Gram(a_1,\dots,a_k)}$.

## Detailed Explanation
This concept is formally defined as:
*   **Definition 1 (Source: Vektorový součin v Rn):** The $k$-dimensional volume of a parallelepiped spanned by vectors ($a_1, \dots, a_k$) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the square root of the Gram determinant of these vectors, i.e., $\sqrt{Gram(a_1,\dots,a_k)}$.
