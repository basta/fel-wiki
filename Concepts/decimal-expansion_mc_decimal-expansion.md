# Decimal Expansion

## Summary
Rational numbers are precisely those with a finite or periodic decimal expansion.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of a decimal expansion relates directly to how rational numbers are represented. A rational number can always be expressed as a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$. When such a fraction is converted to a decimal, the result will either terminate (finite) or repeat a sequence of digits (periodic).

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** "Rational numbers are precisely those with a finite or periodic decimal expansion."

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is moderately important (Importance Score: 0.7) as it provides a fundamental characteristic of rational numbers and distinguishes them from irrational numbers (which have non-repeating, non-terminating decimal expansions).

## Connections
This concept appears in the lecture:
