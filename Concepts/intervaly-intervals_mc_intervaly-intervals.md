# Intervaly (Intervals)

## Summary
Intervals are subsets of real numbers defined by their endpoints, such as open (a,b) or closed [a,b] intervals.

## Detailed Explanation
An interval is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in real analysis and set theory. It represents a continuous range of real numbers. These subsets are uniquely characterized by their endpoints.

One common definition states:
"Subsets of real numbers defined by their endpoints, such as open (a,b) or closed [a,b] intervals." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

Intervals can take various forms based on whether their endpoints are included or excluded:
*   **Open Interval:** $(a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x < b\}$ - excludes both endpoints.
*   **Closed Interval:** $[a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \le x \le b\}$ - includes both endpoints.
*   **Half-Open/Half-Closed Intervals:**
    *   $[a, b) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a \le x < b\}$
    *   $(a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid a < x \le b\}$
*   **Unbounded Intervals:** Intervals can also extend to infinity, e.g., $(a, \infty)$, $(-\infty, b]$, $(-\infty, \infty) = \mathbb{R}$.

## Importance/Relevance
Intervals are highly important (score: 0.7) as they form the basis for defining domains, ranges, and continuity of functions, as well as for expressing solutions to inequalities and describing sets in various mathematical contexts.
