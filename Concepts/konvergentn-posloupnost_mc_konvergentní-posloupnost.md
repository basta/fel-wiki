# KonvergentnÃ­ posloupnost

## Summary
A sequence is convergent if it has a proper (finite) limit.

## Detailed Explanation
A sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is defined as *convergent* if its terms approach a specific, finite real number as $n$ tends to infinity. This finite real number is called the *limit* of the sequence.

Formally, a sequence $(a_n)$ converges to a limit $L \in \mathbb{R}$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number $N$ such that for all $n > N$, $|a_n - L| < \epsilon$. If such a finite limit $L$ exists, the sequence is convergent. If a sequence does not converge to a finite limit (i.e., its limit is $\pm\infty$ or it oscillates without approaching a single value), it is called divergent.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of moderate importance (score: 0.7) as convergence is a cornerstone of mathematical analysis, enabling the study of limits, series, and the approximation of functions, critical for fields like calculus, differential equations, and numerical methods.
