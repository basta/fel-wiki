# jednostrann√° limita (One-sided Limit)

## Summary
A limit approached from only one side of a point (left-sided or right-sided). The overall limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal.

## Detailed Explanation
A one-sided limit refers to the behavior of a function as it approaches a specific point from either the left or the right side. It considers the function's values as the input variable gets arbitrarily close to the point, but only from one direction.

**Definition:**
"A limit approached from only one side of a point (left-sided or right-sided). The overall limit exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

For a general limit $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ to exist, both the left-sided limit ($\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$) and the right-sided limit ($\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$) must exist and be equal to each other.

## Importance/Relevance
One-sided limits are important in calculus (importance score: 0.8 out of 1.0) because they are fundamental for understanding continuity, derivatives, and the existence of a two-sided limit. They are especially crucial when dealing with functions that have discontinuities or are defined piecewise.
