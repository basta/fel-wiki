# Kanonická báze (Canonical Basis)

## Summary
Also known as the standard basis, typically denoted $K_n$ (e.g., $e_1, ..., e_n$) for $F^n$, where elements are standard unit vectors.

## Detailed Explanation
The **canonical basis**, also widely known as the **standard basis**, is a fundamental set of vectors in a vector space. For the space $F^n$ (where F is a field, such as real numbers $\mathbb{R}$), the canonical basis is typically denoted $K_n$ and consists of the standard unit vectors.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (from lec-coordinate-transformation-matrices-05B-2024):** Also known as the standard basis, typically denoted $K_n$ (e.g., $e_1, ..., e_n$) for $F^n$, where elements are standard unit vectors.

For example, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the canonical basis consists of the vectors:
*   $e_1 = (1, 0, 0)$
*   $e_2 = (0, 1, 0)$
*   $e_3 = (0, 0, 1)$

These vectors are mutually orthogonal and have a length of 1, making them very convenient for many calculations.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept holds significant importance as it provides a universally recognized and simple basis for vector spaces, often serving as a reference point for other bases and transformations. It simplifies calculations and theoretical understanding.
