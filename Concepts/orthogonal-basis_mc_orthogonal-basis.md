# Orthogonal Basis

## Summary
An orthogonal set of vectors in a linear space $L$ that forms a basis for $L$. It acts as a 'right-angled coordinate system'.

## Detailed Explanation
An Orthogonal Basis is a special type of basis for a linear space $L$. It combines two key properties:
1.  **Orthogonal Set:** All vectors in the basis are mutually orthogonal (their scalar product is zero).
2.  **Basis:** The vectors are linearly independent and span the entire linear space $L$.

This combination makes an orthogonal basis highly advantageous, as it provides a "right-angled coordinate system" for the vector space. This geometric intuition extends beyond Euclidean space, making calculations simpler and more intuitive, particularly when computing projections or expressing vectors as linear combinations of basis vectors.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.9, an Orthogonal Basis is a highly important concept in linear algebra. It greatly simplifies many computations, such as finding coordinates of a vector, performing orthogonal projections, and solving linear systems. It is foundational for techniques like the Gram-Schmidt process, Fourier analysis, and principal component analysis.
