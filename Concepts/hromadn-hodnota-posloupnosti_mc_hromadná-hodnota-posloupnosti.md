## Summary
A number a ∈ R is an accumulation point (or limit point) of a sequence if every neighborhood of 'a' contains infinitely many terms of the sequence.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of an accumulation point for a sequence is crucial in real analysis. It defines a point around which the sequence "clusters" infinitely often.

**Definition:**
*   A number $a \in R$ is an accumulation point (or limit point) of a sequence if every neighborhood of '$a$' contains infinitely many terms of the sequence.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, this concept is important for understanding the behavior of sequences, especially in the context of convergence and divergence, and is fundamental to concepts like Limes superior and Limes inferior.
