# Ortogonální vektory

## Summary
Two vectors $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal with respect to a scalar product $\langle . | . \rangle$ if their scalar product $\langle x | y \rangle$ equals zero.

## Detailed Explanation
Orthogonal vectors are a pair of vectors that are perpendicular to each other in a geometric sense, or more generally, whose scalar product is zero. This concept is central to understanding bases, projections, and decompositions in vector spaces.

**Definition:**
*   **From linear-algebra-scalar-products-Rn:** Ortogonální vektory are defined as "Two vectors $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal with respect to a scalar product $\langle . | . \rangle$ if their scalar product $\langle x | y \rangle$ equals zero."
