# n-tý částečný součet (n-th partial sum)

## Summary
For an infinite series, the n-th partial sum ($s_n$) is the sum of the first n terms: $a_1 +\dots+ a_n$.

## Detailed Explanation
The n-th partial sum, denoted as $s_n$, is a fundamental concept used to analyze the behavior of an infinite series. For a given infinite numerical series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots$, the n-th partial sum is defined as the sum of its first $n$ terms:

$$ s_n = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k $$

By examining the sequence of these partial sums $(s_1, s_2, s_3, \dots)$, we can determine whether an infinite series converges or diverges.

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is of **moderate importance** (score: 0.7) because it is the crucial bridge connecting the infinite sum of a series to the finite world of sequences. The convergence or divergence of an infinite series is directly determined by the limit of its sequence of partial sums.
