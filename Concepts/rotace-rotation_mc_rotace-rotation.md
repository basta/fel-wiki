# Rotace (Rotation)

## Summary
A linear transformation in R^2 that rotates a vector by a specified angle α around the origin. It's represented by the matrix Rα = [[cos α, -sin α], [sin α, cos α]].

## Detailed Explanation
According to definition from lecture "Lineární zobrazení" (ID: lec_3a1d5599-e40d-4042-832d-d69b45499fe2):
A linear transformation in $R^2$ that rotates a vector by a specified angle $\alpha$ around the origin. It's represented by the matrix $R_\alpha = \begin{bmatrix} \cos \alpha & -\sin \alpha \\ \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha \end{bmatrix}$.
