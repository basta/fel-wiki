# Inflexn√≠ bod

## Summary
A point [a, f(a)] is an inflection point of the graph of f if f is continuous at 'a', f'(a) exists (possibly improper), and f is strictly convex on one side of 'a' and strictly concave on the other side.

## Detailed Explanation
An inflection point of the graph of a function $f$ is a point $[a, f(a)]$ where the concavity of the function changes. Specifically, for $[a, f(a)]$ to be an inflection point, the function $f$ must be continuous at $a$, its first derivative $f'(a)$ must exist (though it can be an improper derivative, meaning $\pm\infty$), and $f$ must be strictly convex on one side of $a$ and strictly concave on the other side. This means that as you move across the inflection point, the curve transitions from "bending upwards" to "bending downwards" or vice-versa.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept holds moderate importance (score: 0.7) as it is crucial for analyzing the shape of a function's graph, identifying where its concavity changes, and understanding its behavior, particularly in curve sketching and optimization problems.
