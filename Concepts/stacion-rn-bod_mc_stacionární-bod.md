# Stacionární bod

## Summary
If a function f has a local extremum at 'a', then f'(a) = 0, and 'a' is called a stationary point. Alternatively, f'(a) may not exist.

## Detailed Explanation
* If a function $f$ has a local extremum at '$a$', then $f'(a) = 0$, and '$a$' is called a stationary point. Alternatively, $f'(a)$ may not exist. (Source: Calculus: Derivatives, Functions, Sequences, and Integrals)
