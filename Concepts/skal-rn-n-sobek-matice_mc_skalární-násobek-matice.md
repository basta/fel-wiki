# Skalární násobek matice

## Summary
An operation where a matrix A is multiplied by a scalar 'a', resulting in a matrix where each entry is 'a' times the corresponding entry of A. In column form, if A=(a1, ..., as), then aA = (aa1, ..., aas).

## Detailed Explanation
Skalární násobek matice, or scalar multiplication of a matrix, is an operation that involves multiplying every entry of a matrix by a single real number (a scalar). This operation scales the matrix without changing its dimensions.

If matrix $A$ has entries $a_{ij}$ and 'a' is a scalar, then the resulting matrix $B = aA$ will have entries $b_{ij} = a \cdot a_{ij}$.

Expressed in column form:
If $A=(a_1, \dots, a_s)$ where $a_i$ are column vectors, then the scalar multiple is $aA = (a a_1, \dots, a a_s)$.
