# Isomorfismus (Isomorphism)

## Summary
A bijective linear transformation. The identity map between a vector space and itself is an isomorphism.

## Detailed Explanation
An **isomorphism** is defined as a bijective linear transformation. This means that the transformation is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (from lec-coordinate-transformation-matrices-05B-2024):** A bijective linear transformation. The identity map between a vector space and itself is an isomorphism.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept holds moderate importance in linear algebra, particularly in understanding when two mathematical structures are essentially the same from a linear transformation perspective. Isomorphisms reveal fundamental structural equivalences between vector spaces.
