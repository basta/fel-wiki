# Cramer's Rule

## Summary
A theorem that provides an explicit formula for the solution of a system of linear equations with a unique solution, expressed in terms of determinants.

## Detailed Explanation
Cramer's Rule is a powerful theorem in linear algebra that offers a direct method for solving systems of linear equations, provided that the system has a unique solution. Its unique characteristic is that it expresses each variable of the solution in terms of ratios of determinants.

*   For a system of $n$ linear equations in $n$ variables, Cramer's Rule uses the determinant of the coefficient matrix and determinants of matrices formed by replacing a column of the coefficient matrix with the constant terms.
*   While theoretically elegant and useful for small systems or proving theoretical results, its computational cost, especially for large systems, is typically higher than other methods like Gaussian elimination, as it requires calculating many determinants.
