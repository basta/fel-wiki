# Konečně generovaný podprostor (Finitely Generated Subspace)

## Summary
A linear subspace $W$ of $L$ is finitely generated if there exists a finite generating set $G$ such that $span(G) = W$.

## Detailed Explanation
A **finitely generated subspace** is a linear subspace that can be "built" or "spanned" by a finite number of vectors. This concept is crucial in linear algebra because it distinguishes between subspaces that have a finite dimension and those that might be infinite-dimensional.

For a linear subspace $W$ of a vector space $L$ to be considered finitely generated, there must exist a specific type of generating set: a **finite generating set**. This means that there is a set $G = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k\}$ containing a finite number of vectors from $L$, such that every vector in $W$ can be expressed as a linear combination of these $k$ vectors. In other words, $span(G) = W$.

If no such finite set exists, the subspace is said to be infinitely generated. In the context of vector spaces, finitely generated subspaces correspond to finite-dimensional vector spaces.

## Key Aspects/Components
N/A - Specific components are not explicitly detailed in the provided data.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is important (Overall Importance Score: 0.7) because it directly relates to the concept of **dimension** in vector spaces. A linear space is finite-dimensional if and only if it is finitely generated. This allows for concrete analysis and computation within these spaces.
