# Střední hodnota f (Mean value of f)

## Summary
The mean value of a function f on an interval (a, b) is (1/(b-a)) ∫_a^b f(x)dx, provided the integral converges.

## Detailed Explanation
The mean value of a function, also known as the average value of a function, extends the concept of an average from a finite set of numbers to a continuous function over an interval. It represents the height of a rectangle over the interval $[a, b]$ whose area is equal to the area under the curve of the function $f(x)$ over that same interval.

The formula for the mean value of a function $f(x)$ on an interval $(a, b)$ is given by:
$$ \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx $$
This definition requires that the definite integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ converges. This concept is closely related to the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept holds moderate importance (score: 0.8) as it provides a way to characterize the "average" behavior of a continuous function over an interval, with applications in physics, engineering, and statistics.
