# Supremum (Least Upper Bound)

## Summary
The smallest upper bound of a set M.

## Detailed Explanation
The **Supremum** of a set $M$, often denoted as $\sup(M)$, is defined as the smallest among all its upper bounds. For a set to have a supremum, it must first be bounded above. If it is bounded above, then the supremum is a unique real number that satisfies two conditions:
1.  It is an upper bound of $M$.
2.  No number smaller than the supremum is an upper bound of $M$.
