# Even Function

## Summary
An even function ƒ is characterized by the property that ƒ(-x) = ƒ(x) for all x in its domain.

## Detailed Explanation
The definition of an even function states:
*   A function ƒ where ƒ(-x) = ƒ(x) for all x in its domain. (Source: calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01)

This means that the function's output value remains the same whether you input 'x' or '-x'. Graphically, this implies that an even function's graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.

## Importance/Relevance
This is an important concept in understanding function properties and simplifying analyses in various mathematical contexts, particularly in calculus and Fourier analysis.
