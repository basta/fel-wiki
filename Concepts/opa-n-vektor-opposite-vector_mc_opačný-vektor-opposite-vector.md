# Opačný vektor (Opposite Vector)

## Summary
For every vector $x$ in a linear space $L$, there exists a unique vector $y$ (denoted as $-x$) such that their sum $x + y$ equals the zero vector $o$. This opposite vector is also shown to be equivalent to the scalar multiplication of $x$ by $-1$, i.e., $(-1) \cdot x$.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of an opposite vector is fundamental to the definition of a linear space. It ensures that for any given vector, there is another vector that, when added to the first, results in the additive identity (the zero vector).

**Definition:**
*   From Lecture "Lineární prostory nad F" (`01B-2024-linear-spaces-over-F`):
    For every vector $x$ in a linear space $L$, there exists a unique vector $y$ (denoted as $-x$) such that $x + y = o$, where $o$ is the zero vector. It is also shown that this unique vector $y$ is equal to $(-1) \cdot x$.

## Key Aspects
*   **Uniqueness:** For any given vector, its opposite vector is unique.
*   **Additive Inverse:** The opposite vector acts as the additive inverse in a linear space.
*   **Scalar Multiplication:** The opposite vector $-x$ can be obtained by multiplying the vector $x$ by the scalar $-1$. This links the additive property to scalar multiplication.

## Importance/Relevance
With an `overallImportanceScore` of 0.7, the opposite vector is a moderately important concept. It is crucial for understanding the axiomatic definition of a linear space, enabling operations like vector subtraction ($x - y = x + (-y)$) and providing the foundation for concepts such as linear independence and basis.
