# dekadick√Ω rozvoj (Decimal Expansion)

## Summary
A way to represent real numbers using digits and powers of 10, typically expressed as $\pm a_0,a_1a_2\ldots=\pm\sum a_n\cdot10^{-n}$.

## Detailed Explanation
Decimal expansion is a system for representing real numbers by using base-10 digits. It involves a whole number part and a fractional part separated by a decimal point. Each digit's position indicates its value as a power of 10. For instance, in $123.45$, '1' is $1 \times 10^2$, '2' is $2 \times 10^1$, '3' is $3 \times 10^0$, '4' is $4 \times 10^{-1}$, and '5' is $5 \times 10^{-2}$.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from "Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis"**: A way to represent real numbers using digits and powers of 10, typically expressed as $\pm a_0,a_1a_2\ldots=\pm\sum a_n\cdot10^{-n}$.

## Importance/Relevance
Decimal expansion is a fundamental concept (score: 0.6) for understanding number representation, particularly for rational and irrational numbers. It is crucial for numerical calculations and forms the basis of our everyday number system.
