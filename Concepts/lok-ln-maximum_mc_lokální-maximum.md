# Lokální maximum

## Summary
A function f has a local maximum at point 'a' if f(x) ≤ f(a) for all x in some punctured neighborhood of 'a'.

## Detailed Explanation
A local maximum indicates a point where the function's value is the largest within a specific, localized region around that point. Similar to a local minimum, it doesn't imply the highest value across the entire domain, but rather the peak within its immediate vicinity.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (Source: MA-Lec-001):** A function f has a local maximum at point 'a' if $f(x) \leq f(a)$ for all x in some punctured neighborhood of 'a'.
