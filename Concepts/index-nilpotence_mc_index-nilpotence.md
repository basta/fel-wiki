# Index nilpotence

## Summary
For a nilpotent linear transformation f, the smallest non-negative integer k such that f^k is the zero transformation (f^k = o). Denoted as nil(f).

## Detailed Explanation
As defined in lecture "Jordanův tvar" (ID: lec_0b7a9823-c557-4731-a7bd-cf65672dba4d), the Index nilpotence for a nilpotent linear transformation $f$ is:
*   The smallest non-negative integer $k$ such that $f^k$ is the zero transformation ($f^k = o$). It is typically denoted as $nil(f)$.

## Importance
