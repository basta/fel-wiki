# Fundamentální systém (Fundamental system)

## Summary
A basis for the kernel (null space) of matrix A (ker(A)). Any solution to a homogeneous system is a linear combination of the vectors in its fundamental system.

## Detailed Explanation
The **Fundamental system** refers to a specific set of vectors that form a basis for the kernel (also known as the null space) of a given matrix A, denoted as ker(A).

According to definition:
*   "A basis for the kernel (null space) of matrix A (ker(A)). Any solution to a homogeneous system is a linear combination of the vectors in its fundamental system." (Source: 06A-2024-GEM-LinearSystems-Part1)

This means that if you have a homogeneous system of linear equations (A**x** = **0**), any possible solution **x** to this system can be expressed as a linear combination of the vectors found in the fundamental system. In essence, the fundamental system provides a complete set of "building blocks" for all solutions to the homogeneous equation.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (score 0.75) as it is crucial for understanding the structure of solutions to linear systems, especially homogeneous ones. It forms the foundation for characterizing the solution space.
