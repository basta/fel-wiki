# Regresní přímka (Regression Line)

## Summary
The 'best possible' straight line that can be fitted through a given set of data points, obtained as a solution using the least squares method to minimize error.

## Detailed Explanation
The Regression Line represents the optimal straight line that can be drawn through a collection of data points. Its primary purpose is to model the relationship between two variables, typically in the context of statistical analysis.

This line is not arbitrarily drawn; it is mathematically derived using the **least squares method**. This method calculates the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed data points and the values predicted by the line. By minimizing this "error," the regression line provides the best linear approximation of the trend in the data.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, the Regression Line is a widely used and fundamental concept in statistics, machine learning, and data analysis. It allows for prediction, trend identification, and understanding of relationships between variables.
