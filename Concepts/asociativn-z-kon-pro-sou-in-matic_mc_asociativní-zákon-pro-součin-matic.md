# Asociativní zákon (pro součin matic)

## Summary
The property C.(B.A) = (C.B).A holds for matrix multiplication whenever the individual products are defined.

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition
The **Associative Law for Matrix Multiplication** states that for any three matrices `C`, `B`, and `A`, the grouping of the matrices during multiplication does not affect the final product, provided that all intermediate products are well-defined. Mathematically, this is expressed as `C.(B.A) = (C.B).A`.

### Elaboration
This means you can multiply `B` by `A` first, and then multiply the result by `C`, or you can multiply `C` by `B` first, and then multiply that result by `A`. As long as the dimensions of the matrices allow for the products to be computed (i.e., the number of columns of the first matrix in a product equals the number of rows of the second), the associativity property holds. This property is crucial for simplifying complex matrix expressions and performing matrix calculations efficiently.

## Importance/Relevance
With an `overallImportanceScore` of 0.8, the Associative Law is an important property in matrix algebra. It ensures consistency in matrix calculations and is foundational for understanding more complex matrix operations and transformations.
