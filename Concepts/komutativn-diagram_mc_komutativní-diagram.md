# Komutativní diagram

## Summary
A diagram of objects and morphisms is commutative if for any two objects in the diagram, all directed paths between them lead to the same result by composition. This concept is illustrated by commutative triangles (h = g · f) and commutative squares (h · f = k · g).

## Detailed Explanation
A **commutative diagram** is a visual representation often used in category theory and related fields (like abstract algebra and topology) to express equations between compositions of functions (morphisms). The term "commutative" means that following different paths of arrows (morphisms) from one object to another in the diagram will always result in the same composite mapping.

### Definition
According to the provided definition from lecture "Souřadnice vzhledem k uspořádané bázi a komutativní diagramy":
"A diagram of objects and morphisms is commutative if for any two objects in the diagram, all directed paths between them lead to the same result by composition. This concept is illustrated by commutative triangles ($h = g \cdot f$) and commutative squares ($h \cdot f = k \cdot g$)."

The definition highlights two common forms:
*   **Commutative Triangle:** If you have mappings $A \rightarrow B$ (say $f$), $B \rightarrow C$ (say $g$), and $A \rightarrow C$ (say $h$), the triangle commutes if $h = g \cdot f$. This means taking the direct path $h$ is equivalent to taking the path $f$ then $g$.
*   **Commutative Square:** For a square with vertices $A, B, C, D$ and mappings $A \rightarrow B$ ($f$), $B \rightarrow D$ ($k$), $A \rightarrow C$ ($g$), and $C \rightarrow D$ ($h$), the square commutes if $k \cdot f = h \cdot g$. Both paths from $A$ to $D$ must yield the same result.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (Importance Score: 0.9) as it provides a powerful visual and conceptual tool for expressing and verifying mathematical identities, especially in advanced topics like category theory and homological algebra. It simplifies complex algebraic statements into intuitive geometric representations.
