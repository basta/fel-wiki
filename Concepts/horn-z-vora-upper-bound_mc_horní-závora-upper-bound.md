# horní závora (Upper Bound)

## Summary
For a set $M$ of real numbers, a number $z$ is an upper bound if all elements in $M$ are less than or equal to $z$ (i.e., for all $x \in M$, $x \le z$).

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of an upper bound is fundamental in real analysis and set theory, particularly when dealing with ordered sets of numbers. It helps to define whether a set is "bounded" from above.

The provided definition states:
"For a set $M$, a number $z$ is an upper bound if all elements in $M$ are less than or equal to $z$ ($M \le z$)." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

In more formal terms, if $M$ is a non-empty subset of the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, a number $z \in \mathbb{R}$ is called an **upper bound** of $M$ if for every element $x$ in $M$, it holds that $x \le z$.

**Example:**
Consider the set $M = \{1, 2, 3\}$.
*   $3$ is an upper bound because $1 \le 3$, $2 \le 3$, $3 \le 3$.
*   $4$ is also an upper bound because $1 \le 4$, $2 \le 4$, $3 \le 4$.
*   Any number greater than or equal to $3$ is an upper bound for this set.

Consider the interval $I = (0, 5)$.
*   $5$ is an upper bound because for any $x \in (0, 5)$, $x < 5$, which implies $x \le 5$.
*   $10$ is also an upper bound.
Any number greater than or equal to $5$ is an upper bound for this set.

If a set has an upper bound, it is said to be **bounded above**. A set can have infinitely many upper bounds if it has at least one. The smallest of all upper bounds is called the **least upper bound** or **supremum**.

## Importance/Relevance
Upper bounds are highly important (score: 0.7) for defining bounded sets, understanding properties of real numbers, and are crucial for the definition of supremum, which plays a vital role in the completeness axiom of real numbers and in various theorems in analysis.
