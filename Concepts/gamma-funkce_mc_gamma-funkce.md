# Gamma funkce

## Summary
The Gamma function, denoted as $\Gamma(x)$, is a special mathematical function that extends the concept of the factorial function to complex numbers. For real numbers $x > 0$, it is defined by the improper integral $\Gamma(x) = \int_0^{+\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt$.

## Detailed Explanation
The factorial function, $n!$, is defined only for non-negative integers. The Gamma function provides a continuous extension of this function to real and complex numbers (with the exception of non-positive integers). This makes it a crucial function in various fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering, particularly in probability and statistics.

### Definition:
*   **Definition 1:** The Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ is defined for complex numbers $x$ with a positive real part ($\text{Re}(x) > 0$) by the integral:
    $$ \Gamma(x) = \int_0^{+\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt $$
    For positive integers $n$, the Gamma function satisfies $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!$, thus extending the factorial concept.

## Importance/Relevance
The Gamma function is of medium importance (overall importance score: 0.6) as a fundamental special function in mathematics. It is used in areas such as statistics (e.g., in the gamma distribution, beta distribution), quantum physics, and various integral transforms. Its ability to generalize factorials makes it indispensable for many analytical computations.
