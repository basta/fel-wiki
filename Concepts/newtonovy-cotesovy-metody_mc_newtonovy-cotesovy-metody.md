# Newtonovy-Cotesovy metody

## Summary
Newton-Cotes methods comprise a family of numerical integration techniques that approximate definite integrals by evaluating the integrand at equally spaced points within the integration interval. These methods can be broadly categorized into closed formulas, which include the interval endpoints, and open formulas, which do not.

## Detailed Explanation
This family of methods forms the basis for many commonly used numerical integration rules (like the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule). They construct an interpolating polynomial through the sampled points and then integrate this polynomial over the interval to approximate the integral of the original function.

### Definition
*   **From Lecture "Mathematical Analysis: Integrals, Series, and Numerical Methods" (ID: lec_0a0dc037-8067-470a-8948-277889b1ab2d):**
    A family of numerical integration methods based on equidistant partitioning of the interval, including closed (endpoints considered) and open (endpoints not considered) formulas.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.8, Newton-Cotes methods are highly significant as foundational techniques in numerical integration, widely used for their simplicity and clear structure, especially when function evaluations can be performed at regular intervals.
