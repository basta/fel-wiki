# prostá (Injective/One-to-one)

## Summary
A function where different inputs correspond to different outputs (each output is mapped by at most one input).

## Detailed Explanation
A function $f: A \to B$ is called **injective** or **one-to-one** (in Czech, "prostá") if distinct elements in its domain $A$ always map to distinct elements in its codomain $B$. In other words, if $x_1 \neq x_2$ for $x_1, x_2 \in A$, then $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$ in $B$. Equivalently, if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then it must be that $x_1 = x_2$. This means that no two distinct inputs produce the same output, and each output value is associated with at most one input value.
