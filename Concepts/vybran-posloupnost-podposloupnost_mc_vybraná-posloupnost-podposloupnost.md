# Vybraná posloupnost (podposloupnost)

## Summary
A sequence formed from the terms of another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Detailed Explanation
A subsequence (or "vybraná posloupnost" in Czech) is essentially a "sequence within a sequence." It is constructed by taking a subset of the elements from an original sequence, while strictly preserving their original relative order. No new elements are introduced, and existing elements are not reordered. For example, if you have the sequence $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots)$, then $(1, 3, 5, \dots)$ is a subsequence, but $(2, 1, 3, \dots)$ is not because the order of 1 and 2 has been changed.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (Source: MA-Lec-001):** A sequence formed from the terms of another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is relevant in the study of sequences and series, particularly when discussing convergence, limits, and accumulation points, as subsequences can inherit properties from the original sequence. It has an overall importance score of 0.65.
