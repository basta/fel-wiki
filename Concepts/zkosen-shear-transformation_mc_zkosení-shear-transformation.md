# Zkosení (Shear Transformation)

## Summary
A linear transformation in R^2 that displaces each point in a fixed direction, proportional to its distance from a line or plane. Represented by the matrix Sa,b = [[1, b], [a, 1]].

## Detailed Explanation
According to definition from lecture "Lineární zobrazení" (ID: lec_3a1d5599-e40d-4042-832d-d69b45499fe2):
A linear transformation in $R^2$ that displaces each point in a fixed direction, proportional to its distance from a line or plane. Represented by the matrix $S_{a,b} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & b \\ a & 1 \end{bmatrix}$.

## Importance/Relevance
