# Diagonalisovatelná matice

## Summary
A square matrix A is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix D, i.e., D = T⁻¹AT for some invertible matrix T.

## Detailed Explanation
A square matrix A is called diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix. This means that there exists an invertible matrix T (often composed of eigenvectors of A) such that when A is transformed by T, it becomes a diagonal matrix D. The elements on the diagonal of D are the eigenvalues of A.

The ability to diagonalize a matrix simplifies many computations involving the matrix, such as calculating powers of the matrix, solving systems of differential equations, or understanding the long-term behavior of dynamic systems.

**Definition:**
*   A square matrix A is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix D, i.e., D = T⁻¹AT for some invertible matrix T. (Source: Lecture "Jordanův tvar")
