# Obdélníková metoda (Midpoint Rule)

## Summary
The Midpoint Rule (Obdélníková metoda) is a simple numerical integration method that approximates the definite integral of a function by summing the areas of rectangles. For each subinterval, the height of the rectangle is determined by the function's value at the midpoint of that subinterval.

## Detailed Explanation
This method provides a basic yet often effective way to estimate the area under a curve. By using the midpoint, it tends to balance out errors that might occur if one were to use only the left or right endpoint of each subinterval. It is one of the simplest Newton-Cotes open formulas.

### Definition
*   **From Lecture "Mathematical Analysis: Integrals, Series, and Numerical Methods" (ID: lec_0a0dc037-8067-470a-8948-277889b1ab2d):**
    A numerical integration method where the functional value at the midpoint of each subinterval is used to approximate the area of a rectangle.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.6, the Midpoint Rule is a moderately important and fundamental numerical integration method. It serves as a good introductory example for understanding numerical integration principles and can be surprisingly accurate for its simplicity.
