# Bijective Function (vzájemně jednoznačná)

## Summary
A function that is both injective and surjective.

## Detailed Explanation
A bijective function, often called a one-to-one correspondence, possesses both the properties of injectivity and surjectivity. This means that each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain (injective), and every element in the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element from the domain (surjective). Bijective functions establish a perfect pairing between elements of two sets.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** A function that is both injective and surjective.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of moderate importance (score: 0.7) as bijective functions are critical in many areas of mathematics, including algebra (for isomorphisms), set theory (for establishing cardinality), and analysis (for invertible functions).
