# Hodnost (rank(f))

## Summary
The rank of a linear transformation f is the dimension of its image, rank(f) = dim(im(f)).

## Detailed Explanation
The rank of a linear transformation $f$ is formally defined as the dimension of its image. This can be written as:
$$ \text{rank}(f) = \text{dim}(\text{im}(f)) $$
This definition comes from the lecture "Lineární zobrazení, část 2" (ID: 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2).
