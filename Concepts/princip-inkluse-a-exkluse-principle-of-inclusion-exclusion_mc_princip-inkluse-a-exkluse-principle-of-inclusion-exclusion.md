# Princip inkluse a exkluse (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion)

## Summary
For finite sets A and B, the principle states that $\text{card}(A \cup B) + \text{card}(A \cap B) = \text{card}(A) + \text{card}(B)$. This concept is analogous to the dimension formula for sums and intersections of subspaces.

## Detailed Explanation
According to Báze a dimense:
For finite sets $A$ and $B$, the principle states that $\text{card}(A \cup B) + \text{card}(A \cap B) = \text{card}(A) + \text{card}(B)$. This concept is analogous to the dimension formula for sums and intersections of subspaces.

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is very important for understanding counting in combinatorics and has a significant analogy in linear algebra with the dimension formula for subspaces.
