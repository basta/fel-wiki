# Partikulární řešení (Particular solution)

## Summary
Any single solution to a non-homogeneous system of linear equations A**x** = **b**. The general solution is expressed as the sum of a particular solution and any solution from the corresponding homogeneous system.

## Detailed Explanation
A **Particular solution** is any single vector **x** that satisfies a given non-homogeneous system of linear equations, represented as A**x** = **b**, where **b** is a non-zero vector.

According to definition:
*   "Any single solution to a non-homogeneous system of linear equations A x = b. The general solution is expressed as the sum of a particular solution and any solution from the corresponding homogeneous system." (Source: 06A-2024-GEM-LinearSystems-Part1)

Unlike homogeneous systems which always have the trivial solution, non-homogeneous systems might have no solution, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. When solutions exist, the particular solution helps to define the entire set of solutions. The structure of the general solution to a non-homogeneous system is given by $\mathbf{x}_{\text{general}} = \mathbf{x}_{\text{particular}} + \mathbf{x}_{\text{homogeneous}}$, where $\mathbf{x}_{\text{homogeneous}}$ is any solution to the corresponding homogeneous system A**x** = **0**.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (score 0.75) for solving and understanding non-homogeneous linear systems, as it provides a component necessary to construct the complete set of solutions.
