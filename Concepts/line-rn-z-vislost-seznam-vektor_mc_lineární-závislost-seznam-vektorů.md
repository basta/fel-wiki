# Lineární závislost (seznam vektorů)

## Summary
A list S of vectors is linearly dependent if it is not linearly independent. This means there exists a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector.

## Detailed Explanation
- A list S of vectors is linearly dependent if it is not linearly independent. This means there exists a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector.
