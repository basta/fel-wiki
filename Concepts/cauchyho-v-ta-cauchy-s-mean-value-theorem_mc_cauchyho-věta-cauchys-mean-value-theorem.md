# Cauchyho věta (Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem)

## Summary
If $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $g'(x) \neq 0$ on $(a,b)$, then there exists $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$.

## Detailed Explanation
Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem, also known as the Generalized Mean Value Theorem, is a significant extension of the Mean Value Theorem. It relates the rates of change of two functions over an interval.

**Definition:**
*   If $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, and $g'(x) \neq 0$ on $(a,b)$, then there exists a $c \in (a,b)$ such that:
    $$ \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)} $$

## Importance/Relevance
This theorem is quite important (score: 0.8/1.0) as it serves as a crucial intermediate step in the proof of L'Hôpital's Rule, and it generalizes the concept of the Mean Value Theorem to a ratio of two functions.
