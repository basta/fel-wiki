# Lineární nezávislost

## Summary
A set of vectors ($a_1, \dots, a_k$) is linearly independent if and only if their Gram determinant $Gram(a_1,\dots,a_k) > 0$. Equivalently, the vector product $\times(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})$ is the zero vector if and only if the vectors $x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}$ are linearly dependent.

## Detailed Explanation
This concept is formally defined as:
*   **Definition 1 (Source: Vektorový součin v Rn):** A set of vectors ($a_1, \dots, a_k$) is linearly independent if and only if their Gram determinant $Gram(a_1,\dots,a_k) > 0$. Equivalently, the vector product $\times(x_1,\dots,x_{n-1})$ is the zero vector if and only if the vectors $x_1, \dots, x_{n-1}$ are linearly dependent.

## Importance/Relevance
