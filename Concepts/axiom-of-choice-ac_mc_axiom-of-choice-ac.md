# Axiom of Choice (AC)

## Summary
A fundamental axiom in set theory stating that for any collection of non-empty sets, there exists a choice function that picks exactly one element from each set. In linear algebra, it implies that every linear space has a basis, often via Zorn's Lemma.

## Detailed Explanation
According to Báze a dimense:

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is important as a foundational axiom in set theory with significant implications in linear algebra, particularly regarding the existence of bases for all linear spaces.
