# Lineární závislost (množina vektorů)

## Summary
A set M of vectors is linearly dependent if it is not linearly independent. This implies that there is a non-trivial linear combination of vectors from M that sums to the zero vector.

## Detailed Explanation
A set M of vectors is defined as linearly dependent if it fails to be linearly independent. This means that you can find a combination of these vectors, where not all the coefficients are zero, that results in the zero vector. This is often stated as: there exists a non-trivial linear combination of vectors from M that sums to the zero vector.
