# Asymptota grafu funkce

## Summary
If a function f has at least one improper one-sided limit at 'a' ∈ R, then the line x=a is a vertical asymptote. If f has a limit at a ∈ {±∞} such that lim(f(x) - px - q) = 0, then y=px+q is an oblique (or slant) asymptote.

## Detailed Explanation
An asymptote is a line that the graph of a function approaches as the $x$ or $y$ values tend towards infinity. There are two main types described:

1.  **Vertical Asymptote:** A vertical line $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote if the function $f$ has at least one improper one-sided limit at $a \in \mathbb{R}$. This means that as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left or right, the function's value $f(x)$ tends to positive or negative infinity ($ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \pm\infty $ or $ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \pm\infty $).

2.  **Oblique (Slant) or Horizontal Asymptote:** A line $y=px+q$ is an oblique asymptote if, as $x$ approaches $\pm\infty$, the difference between the function $f(x)$ and the line $px+q$ approaches zero. That is, $ \lim_{x \to \pm\infty} (f(x) - px - q) = 0 $. If $p=0$, the asymptote is horizontal ($y=q$).
