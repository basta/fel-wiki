# Poissonova závorka

## Summary
For matrices σj, σk, it is defined as {σj, σk} = σjσk + σkσj.

## Detailed Explanation
The Poissonova závorka (Poisson Bracket in this context, although the term typically refers to a different concept in Hamiltonian mechanics, here it's defined for matrices) for two matrices $\sigma_j$ and $\sigma_k$ is defined as their anti-commutator. Specifically, it is given by the formula:
$$ {\sigma_j, \sigma_k} = \sigma_j\sigma_k + \sigma_k\sigma_j $$
This operation measures how much two matrices "commute" in an additive sense, providing a symmetric counterpart to the commutator.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has medium importance (score: 0.4), defining a specific algebraic operation for matrices which can be relevant in contexts like algebra or quantum mechanics, particularly when dealing with products of operators.
