# Vzor (Preimage)

## Summary
In the context of solving A·x = b, finding the vector x for a given vector b is equivalent to finding the preimage of b under the linear mapping A.

## Detailed Explanation
The term "preimage" refers to the set of all elements in the domain of a function that map to a particular element in the codomain. In linear algebra, specifically with linear mappings (often represented by a matrix A), the preimage of a vector 'b' is the set of all input vectors 'x' that, when transformed by A, yield 'b'.

### Definition:
In the context of solving $A \cdot x = b$, finding the vector $x$ for a given vector $b$ is equivalent to finding the preimage of $b$ under the linear mapping $A$.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is important (overall importance score of 0.6) for understanding the inverse problem in linear mappings and functions, providing a perspective on how inputs relate to specific outputs. It helps clarify the relationship between the domain and codomain of a linear transformation.
