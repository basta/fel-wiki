# Jordanův tvar

## Summary

The Jordan form of a linear transformation $f$ is an 'almost diagonal form'. It allows for the decomposition of $f$ into a sum of a diagonal part and a nilpotent part ($f = \text{diagonal} + \text{nilpotent}$).

## Detailed Explanation

In linear algebra, not all matrices can be diagonalized. The Jordan Canonical Form (or Jordanův tvar) provides the "next best" thing: a matrix representation that is as close to diagonal as possible. It is a fundamental result for understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces.

**Definition:**
*   The Jordan form of a linear transformation $f$ is an 'almost diagonal form', where $f$ can be decomposed into a sum of a diagonal part and a nilpotent part ($f = \text{diagonal} + \text{nilpotent}$). This definition comes from the lecture "Jordanův tvar".

This decomposition is crucial because it allows us to analyze the behavior of complex linear transformations by breaking them down into simpler, well-understood components. The "diagonal part" captures the scaling behavior (eigenvalues), while the "nilpotent part" accounts for any non-diagonalizable behavior.

## Importance

With an overall importance score of 1.0, the Jordan form is a critically important **Core Principle** in linear algebra. It is essential for understanding the structure of linear transformations, solving systems of differential equations, and analyzing dynamical systems, especially when a matrix is not diagonalizable.
