# Nulový vektor (Zero Vector)

## Summary
A unique vector 'o' in a linear space L such that for any vector x, $x + o = o + x = x$.

## Detailed Explanation
In a linear space (or vector space), the zero vector plays a role similar to the number zero in arithmetic. It is the additive identity element for vector addition.

**Definition (Source: 01B-2024-linear-spaces-over-F):** A unique vector 'o' in a linear space L such that for any vector x, $x + o = o + x = x$.

Often denoted by $\mathbf{0}$ (bold zero), the zero vector is an essential component of the axioms defining a linear space. It is unique for any given linear space. For instance, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, the zero vector is the vector with all components equal to zero, e.g., $(0, 0)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an overall importance score of 0.85. The zero vector is fundamental for defining linear spaces and understanding vector addition. It provides a reference point for vectors and is crucial for concepts like linear independence, basis, and subspace definitions.
