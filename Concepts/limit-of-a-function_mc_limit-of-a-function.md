# Limit of a Function

## Summary
The limit of a function describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain point. Specifically, for a function ƒ defined in a punctured neighborhood of 'a', its limit 'b' means that for every neighborhood U of 'b', there exists a punctured neighborhood P of 'a' such that ƒ(P) is a subset of U.

## Detailed Explanation
One formal definition of the limit of a function is:
*   For a function ƒ defined in a punctured neighborhood of 'a', its limit 'b' means that for every neighborhood U of 'b', there exists a punctured neighborhood P of 'a' such that ƒ(P) is a subset of U. (Source: calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01)

This definition, often called the "epsilon-delta" definition in elementary calculus (though stated here in terms of neighborhoods), precisely captures the idea that the function's output values ($f(x)$) get arbitrarily close to 'b' as the input values ($x$) get arbitrarily close to 'a' (but not necessarily equal to 'a').

## Importance/Relevance
The concept of the limit of a function is a fundamental and core principle in calculus. It forms the bedrock for defining continuity, derivatives, and integrals, making it indispensable for understanding advanced mathematical concepts.
