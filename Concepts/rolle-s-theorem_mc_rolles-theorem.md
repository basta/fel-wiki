# Rolle's Theorem

## Summary
If ƒ is continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and ƒ(a) = ƒ(b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that ƒ'(c) = 0.

## Detailed Explanation
Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem and is a foundational result in differential calculus. It provides conditions under which a differentiable function must have a point where its derivative is zero (i.e., a horizontal tangent line). Geometrically, if a continuous and differentiable curve starts and ends at the same height, there must be at least one point in between where the tangent to the curve is horizontal.

**Definition:**
*   From `calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01`: "If ƒ is continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and ƒ(a) = ƒ(b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that $ƒ'(c) = 0$."

## Importance/Relevance
Rolle's Theorem is important as it is a crucial step in proving other fundamental theorems in calculus, most notably the Mean Value Theorem. With an overall importance score of 0.8, it is considered an important concept.
