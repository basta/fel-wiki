# hustota (Density)

## Summary
Density is the property that in every interval, there exist infinitely many rational and irrational numbers, meaning both sets are dense in the real numbers.

## Detailed Explanation
In the context of real numbers, density refers to how "closely packed" the elements of a subset are within a larger set. A set $A$ is said to be *dense* in a set $B$ if every point in $B$ can be approximated arbitrarily closely by points in $A$. More formally, for any point $x \in B$ and any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a point $a \in A$ such that $|x - a| < \epsilon$.

Specifically, the definition provided states:
"The property that in every interval, there exist infinitely many rational and irrational numbers, meaning both sets are dense in the real numbers." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

This highlights a crucial characteristic of the real number line:
*   **Density of Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$) in Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$):** Between any two distinct real numbers (or within any open interval), there is always a rational number. In fact, there are infinitely many. This means that rational numbers "fill" the real number line in a dense way.
*   **Density of Irrational Numbers ($\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q}$) in Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$):** Similarly, between any two distinct real numbers, there is always an irrational number, and again, infinitely many. Irrational numbers also "fill" the real number line densely.

This property implies that no matter how small an interval you pick on the real number line, you will always find both rational and irrational numbers within it.

## Importance/Relevance
The concept of density is highly important (score: 0.7) in real analysis. It underlies many foundational theorems, such as the completeness of the real numbers, and is crucial for understanding limits, continuity, and the structure of number sets.
