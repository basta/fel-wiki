# Ekvivalentní soustavy (Equivalent systems)

## Summary
Two systems of linear equations (A | b) and (A' | b') are equivalent if for every vector x, A x = b if and only if A' x = b', meaning they have the same set of solutions.

## Detailed Explanation
In the realm of linear algebra, two systems of linear equations are considered equivalent if they possess precisely the same set of solutions. This means that any vector $x$ that satisfies the first system, $A x = b$, will also satisfy the second system, $A' x = b'$, and vice versa. The transformation from one system to an equivalent one is typically achieved through elementary row operations, which do not alter the solution set.

A formal definition states:
*   **Definition:** Two systems of linear equations $(A | b)$ and $(A' | b')$ are equivalent if for every vector $x$, $A x = b$ if and only if $A' x = b'$, meaning they have the same set of solutions. (Source: 06A-2024-GEM-LinearSystems-Part1)

## Importance/Relevance
Understanding equivalent systems is fundamental in solving linear equations, as it allows us to transform a complex system into a simpler, yet equally valid, one through operations like Gaussian elimination, without altering its solution set. This concept has a high importance score of 0.8.
