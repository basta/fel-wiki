# Lorentzova metrika (Lorentz Metric)

## Summary

The Lorentz Metric is a non-positive definite 'scalar product' defined in $\mathbb{R}^4$. It is crucial in the theory of relativity for defining distances in Minkowski spacetime.

## Detailed Explanation

The Lorentz Metric provides a way to measure "distances" or "intervals" in a four-dimensional spacetime, which is different from how Euclidean distances are measured. Unlike a standard scalar product (or dot product) which is positive definite, the Lorentz Metric is *non-positive definite*.

**Definition:**
*   A non-positive definite 'scalar product' in $\mathbb{R}^4$, defined as $\langle(t,x,y,z) | (t',x',y',z')\rangle = tt' - xx' - yy' - zz'$. This definition comes from the lecture "Abstraktní skalární součin".

This specific definition highlights the key difference: while the time components multiply positively, the spatial components multiply negatively. This mathematical structure is fundamental to understanding phenomena like time dilation and length contraction in special relativity.

## Importance

With an overall importance score of 0.8, the Lorentz Metric is a highly important concept, particularly in physics, as it forms the mathematical bedrock for describing spacetime in the theory of relativity.

## Connections

This concept appears in the lecture series titled "Abstraktní skalární součin".

## Category

This concept is categorized as a **Special Case**.
