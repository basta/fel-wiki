# Distributivní zákony (Distributive Laws)

## Summary
Connects addition and multiplication: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ (left distributivity) and $(b+c)a = ba + ca$ (right distributivity).

## Detailed Explanation
The distributive laws are crucial axioms in algebra that link the operations of addition and multiplication. They describe how multiplication "distributes" over addition.

**Definition (Source: 01B-2024-linear-spaces-over-F):** Connects addition and multiplication: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ (left distributivity) and $(b+c)a = ba + ca$ (right distributivity).

In a field, because multiplication is commutative, left and right distributivity are equivalent. However, in more general algebraic structures like rings, both forms are often explicitly stated as separate axioms.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an overall importance score of 0.75. Distributive laws are fundamental for algebraic manipulation, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. They are also essential axioms for defining vector spaces, where scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition and scalar addition.
