# Absolutně konvergentní řada (Absolutely convergent series)

## Summary
A series $$ \sum a_k $$ converges absolutely if the series of the absolute values of its terms, $$ \sum|a_k| $$, converges.

## Detailed Explanation
Absolute convergence is a stronger condition than mere convergence for a series. Understanding whether a series converges absolutely is crucial because absolutely convergent series exhibit many desirable properties, such as allowing rearrangement of terms without changing the sum.

As defined in lecture lec-math-2023-001:
*   "A series $$ \sum a_k $$ converges absolutely if the series of the absolute values of its terms, $$ \sum|a_k| $$, converges."

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important as it defines a crucial property of series that ensures their robust behavior, especially regarding operations like rearrangement.
