# Lokální minimum

## Summary
A function f has a local minimum at point 'a' if f(x) ≥ f(a) for all x in some punctured neighborhood of 'a'.

## Detailed Explanation
A local minimum represents a point where the function's value is the smallest within a specific, localized region around that point. It doesn't necessarily mean it's the absolute lowest value the function takes over its entire domain, but rather the lowest value in its immediate vicinity.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (Source: MA-Lec-001):** A function f has a local minimum at point 'a' if $f(x) \geq f(a)$ for all x in some punctured neighborhood of 'a'.
