# Součet matic

## Summary
An operation where for two matrices A and B of the same dimensions, A+B results in a matrix where each entry is the sum of the corresponding entries of A and B. In column form, if A=(a1, ..., as) and B=(b1,..., bs), then A+B = (a1+b1, ..., as+bs).

## Detailed Explanation
Součet matic, or matrix addition, is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that combines two matrices into a single matrix. For matrix addition to be possible, the two matrices must have the exact same dimensions (i.e., the same number of rows and the same number of columns).

The operation is performed element-wise:
If matrix $A$ has entries $a_{ij}$ and matrix $B$ has entries $b_{ij}$, then their sum $C = A+B$ will have entries $c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}$.

Expressed in column form:
If $A=(a_1, \dots, a_s)$ where $a_i$ are column vectors, and $B=(b_1, \dots, b_s)$ where $b_i$ are column vectors, then their sum is $A+B = (a_1+b_1, \dots, a_s+b_s)$.

In column form, if A=(a1, ..., as) and B=(b1,..., bs), then A+B = (a1+b1, ..., as+bs)."
