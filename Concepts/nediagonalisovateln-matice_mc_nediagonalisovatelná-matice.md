# Nediagonalisovatelná matice

## Summary
A matrix for which the direct sum of its eigenspaces does not span the entire vector space, often due to geometric multiplicity being less than algebraic multiplicity for some eigenvalues.

## Detailed Explanation
A non-diagonalizable matrix is one that cannot be transformed into a diagonal matrix by similarity transformation. This typically occurs when there aren't enough linearly independent eigenvectors to form a basis for the entire vector space. Specifically, it happens when, for at least one eigenvalue, its geometric multiplicity (the dimension of its eigenspace) is strictly less than its algebraic multiplicity (the multiplicity of the eigenvalue as a root of the characteristic polynomial).

Understanding non-diagonalizable matrices is crucial, as they lead to more complex canonical forms, such as the Jordan Canonical Form, which can still provide a simplified representation, albeit not fully diagonal.
