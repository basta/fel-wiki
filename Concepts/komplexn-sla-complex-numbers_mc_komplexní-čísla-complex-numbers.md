# komplexní čísla (Complex Numbers)

## Summary
The set of complex numbers, denoted by C = {x+iy: x, y ∈R}, where i² = −1.

## Detailed Explanation
Complex numbers extend the concept of real numbers by including an imaginary unit, $i$, defined by the property $i^2 = -1$. A complex number is typically expressed in the form $x + iy$, where $x$ is the real part and $y$ is the imaginary part, and both $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from "Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis"**: The set of complex numbers, denoted by C = {x+iy: x, y ∈R}, where $i^2 = -1$.

## Importance/Relevance
Complex numbers are important (score: 0.7) in various fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering, particularly in electrical engineering, signal processing, and quantum mechanics. They allow for the solution of polynomial equations that have no real solutions.
