# L'Hôpital's Rule

## Summary
If lim (x->a+) ƒ(x) = lim (x->a+) g(x) = 0 or ±∞, and lim (x->a+) ƒ'(x)/g'(x) = b exists, then lim (x->a+) ƒ(x)/g(x) = b.

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition 1
If lim (x->a+) ƒ(x) = lim (x->a+) g(x) = 0 or ±∞, and lim (x->a+) ƒ'(x)/g'(x) = b exists, then lim (x->a+) ƒ(x)/g(x) = b.
