# Vlastní podprostor (Eigenspace)

## Summary
For any $\lambda$ in F, the set {x | $f(x) = \lambda x$} forms a subspace ker($f - \lambda id$), which is called the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda$ (denoted eigen($\lambda$, f)).

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition
For any $\lambda$ in F, the set {x | $f(x) = \lambda x$} forms a subspace ker($f - \lambda id$), which is called the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda$ (denoted eigen($\lambda$, f)). (Source: lecture-eigenvalues-eigenvectors-08a-2024)

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is moderately important (score: 0.75) as it provides a geometric interpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, revealing the directions along which a linear transformation acts merely by scaling.
