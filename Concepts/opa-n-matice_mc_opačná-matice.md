## Summary
For a matrix A, the unique matrix B such that A+B = Os,r, denoted -A.

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition
The **Opposite Matrix** (or Additive Inverse Matrix) for a given matrix `A` is defined as the unique matrix `B` such that when `A` and `B` are added together, the result is the Null Matrix (`Os,r`). This unique matrix `B` is typically denoted as `-A`.

In essence, if `A` has entries `aij`, then the entries of `-A` are simply `-aij`. This ensures that `aij + (-aij) = 0` for all corresponding entries, resulting in the Null Matrix.

## Importance/Relevance
With an `overallImportanceScore` of 0.6, the Opposite Matrix is a moderately important concept. It is fundamental to understanding matrix subtraction and the properties of matrix addition, providing the inverse operation necessary to return to the additive identity.
