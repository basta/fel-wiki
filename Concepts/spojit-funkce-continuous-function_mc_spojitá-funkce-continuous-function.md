# Spojit√° funkce (Continuous Function)

## Summary
A function $f$ is continuous at a point $a$ in its domain if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$. A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain.

## Detailed Explanation
Continuity is a fundamental property of functions in calculus that describes a function whose graph can be drawn without lifting the pen. More formally, a function is continuous at a point if three conditions are met:
1.  The function is defined at that point ($f(a)$ exists).
2.  The limit of the function exists at that point ($\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists).
3.  The limit of the function at that point is equal to the function's value at that point ($\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$).

**Definition:**
"A function $f$ is continuous at a point $a$ in its domain if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$. A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

If a function is continuous at every point within an interval, it is said to be continuous on that interval.

## Importance/Relevance
The concept of a continuous function is highly important in mathematics (importance score: 0.9 out of 1.0) as it forms the basis for many theorems in calculus, such as the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Extreme Value Theorem. Continuous functions are pervasive in modeling real-world phenomena because they often represent processes that evolve smoothly without sudden jumps or breaks.
