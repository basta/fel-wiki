# Divergence řady (Series Divergence)

## Summary
A series diverges if its sequence of partial sums has an infinite limit.

## Detailed Explanation
An infinite numerical series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k$ is said to **diverge** if its sequence of partial sums, $(s_n)_{n=1}^\infty$, does not approach a finite limit as $n$ tends to infinity. Specifically, if the limit of the partial sums is positive infinity or negative infinity:

$$ \lim_{n\to\infty} s_n = \infty \quad \text{or} \quad \lim_{n\to\infty} s_n = -\infty $$

In such cases, the sum of the series cannot be assigned a finite numerical value. A common example of a divergent series is the harmonic series, $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}$.

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is of **high importance** (score: 0.8) as it describes the behavior of series that do not sum to a finite value. Recognizing divergence is crucial to avoid incorrect calculations or applications of mathematical tools that rely on the existence of a finite sum. It is also important in understanding the boundaries of series behavior.
