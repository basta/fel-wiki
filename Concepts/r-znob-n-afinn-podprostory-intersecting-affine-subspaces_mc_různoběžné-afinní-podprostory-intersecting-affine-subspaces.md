# Různoběžné afinní podprostory (Intersecting Affine Subspaces)

## Summary
Two affine subspaces π = p + W and π' = p' + W' are intersecting (or non-parallel) if they are not parallel and have at least one common point.

## Detailed Explanation
- Two affine subspaces π = p + W and π' = p' + W' are intersecting (or non-parallel) if they are not parallel and have at least one common point. (Source: linear-algebra-affine-subspaces-relative-position-12A-2024)
