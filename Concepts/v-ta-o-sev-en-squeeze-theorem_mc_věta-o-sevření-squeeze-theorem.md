# Věta o sevření (Squeeze Theorem)

## Summary
If $f(x) \le h(x) \le g(x)$ in a punctured neighborhood of $a$, and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = b$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = b$, then $\lim_{x \to a} h(x) = b$.

## Detailed Explanation
The Squeeze Theorem, also known as the Sandwich Theorem, is a powerful tool used to determine the limit of a function that is "squeezed" between two other functions. If two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both approach the same limit $b$ as $x$ approaches $a$, and a third function $h(x)$ is always between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ in a neighborhood of $a$, then $h(x)$ must also approach the same limit $b$.

**Definition:**
"If $f(x) \le h(x) \le g(x)$ in a punctured neighborhood of $a$, and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = b$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = b$, then $\lim_{x \to a} h(x) = b$." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

This theorem is particularly useful for finding limits of functions that are difficult to evaluate directly, often involving trigonometric functions or functions with oscillating behavior.

## Importance/Relevance
The Squeeze Theorem is an important concept in calculus (importance score: 0.8 out of 1.0) due to its utility in evaluating limits that are otherwise indeterminate. It is frequently used in proving fundamental limits, such as $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$.
