# Matice (Matrix)

## Summary
A rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Used to represent linear transformations and systems of linear equations.

## Detailed Explanation
A matrix is a fundamental mathematical object that organizes data into a rectangular grid. Each entry in the grid is called an element or entry of the matrix. Matrices are widely used because they provide a concise and powerful way to represent and manipulate linear transformations, systems of linear equations, and data in various forms.

*   Matrices are defined by their dimensions, specifically the number of rows ($m$) and columns ($n$), denoted as an $m \times n$ matrix.
*   They are essential in fields such as computer graphics, physics, engineering, economics, and statistics, for tasks ranging from solving complex equations to representing networks and transformations in 3D space.

**Definition:**
*   A rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Used to represent linear transformations and systems of linear equations. (Source: 06A-2024-GEM-LinearSystems-Part1)
