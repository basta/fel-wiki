# Komutátor

## Summary
For matrices σj, σk, it is defined as [σj, σk] = σjσk - σkσj.

## Detailed Explanation
The Komutátor (Commutator) for two matrices $\sigma_j$ and $\sigma_k$ is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and quantum mechanics. It is defined as the difference between their products in opposite orders:
$$ [\sigma_j, \sigma_k] = \sigma_j\sigma_k - \sigma_k\sigma_j $$
The commutator quantifies the extent to which two operators or matrices fail to commute. If the commutator is zero, the matrices commute.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has medium importance (score: 0.4). It is crucial for understanding non-commutative algebras and plays a significant role in quantum mechanics, where it relates to the uncertainty principle between observable quantities.
