# Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem

## Summary
If ƒ and g are continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and g'(x) ≠ 0 on (a,b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that (f(b)-f(a))/(g(b)-g(a)) = f'(c)/g'(c).

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition 1
If ƒ and g are continuous on [a,b], differentiable on (a,b), and g'(x) ≠ 0 on (a,b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that (f(b)-f(a))/(g(b)-g(a)) = f'(c)/g'(c).
