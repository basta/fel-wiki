# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Summary
Any matrix $M$ can be written as $M = USV^T$, where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices and $S$ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values.

## Detailed Explanation
*   Any matrix $M$ can be written as $M = USV^T$, where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices and $S$ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values. (Source: svd-pseudoinverse-lecture)
