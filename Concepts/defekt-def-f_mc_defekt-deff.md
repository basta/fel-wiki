# Defekt (def(f))

## Summary
The defect of a linear transformation f is the dimension of its kernel, def(f) = dim(ker(f)).

## Detailed Explanation
*   The defect of a linear transformation f is the dimension of its kernel, def(f) = dim(ker(f)). (Source: 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2)

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an importance score of 75%. The defect quantifies the 'loss of information' or 'collapse' that a linear transformation causes. It plays a key role in the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which relates the dimensions of the domain, kernel (defect), and image (rank) of a linear transformation.
