# Invariantní podprostor

## Summary
A subspace W of a vector space V is invariant under a linear transformation T if T(W) is a subset of W. This means T maps vectors from W back into W.

## Detailed Explanation
An invariant subspace is a special kind of subspace that remains "unchanged" by a linear transformation, in the sense that applying the transformation to any vector within the subspace always results in another vector that is also within that same subspace. It does not mean the vectors themselves are fixed, but rather the subspace as a whole is preserved under the transformation.

This property is extremely useful because it allows for the decomposition of complex linear transformations into simpler transformations acting on these invariant subspaces.

**Definition:**
*   A subspace W of a vector space V is invariant under a linear transformation T if T(W) is a subset of W. This means T maps vectors from W back into W. (Source: Lecture "Jordanův tvar")
