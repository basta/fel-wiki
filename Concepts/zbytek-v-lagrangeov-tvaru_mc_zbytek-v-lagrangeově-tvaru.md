## Summary
The remainder term in Taylor's Theorem, indicating the error of the Taylor polynomial approximation. It is given by f^(n+1)(c) / (n+1)! * (x-a)^(n+1) for some c between a and x.

## Detailed Explanation
* The remainder term in Taylor's Theorem, indicating the error of the Taylor polynomial approximation. It is given by $f^{(n+1)}(c) / (n+1)! \cdot (x-a)^{(n+1)}$ for some $c$ between $a$ and $x$. (Source: Calculus: Derivatives, Functions, Sequences, and Integrals)
