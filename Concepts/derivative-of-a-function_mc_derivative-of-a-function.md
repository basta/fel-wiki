# Derivative of a Function

## Summary
The derivative of a function ƒ at a point 'a', denoted ƒ'(a) or df/dx(a), is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as h approaches zero: $\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$, or equivalently, $\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$.

## Detailed Explanation
The derivative of a function is a cornerstone concept in differential calculus. It represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function with respect to its independent variable, or geometrically, the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at a given point.
