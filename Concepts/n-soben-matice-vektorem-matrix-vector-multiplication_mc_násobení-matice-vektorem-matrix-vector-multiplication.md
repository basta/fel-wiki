# Násobení matice vektorem (Matrix-Vector Multiplication)

## Summary
The operation where a matrix A multiplies a vector x, resulting in a new vector. If A's columns are a_j and x's components are x_j, then A·x is defined as the linear combination Σ (x_j a_j). This operation represents the application of the linear transformation associated with matrix A to vector x.

## Detailed Explanation
According to definition from lecture "Lineární zobrazení" (ID: lec_3a1d5599-e40d-4042-832d-d69b45499fe2):
The operation where a matrix $A$ multiplies a vector $x$, resulting in a new vector. If $A$'s columns are $a_j$ and $x$'s components are $x_j$, then $A \cdot x$ is defined as the linear combination $\sum (x_j a_j)$. This operation represents the application of the linear transformation associated with matrix $A$ to vector $x$.

## Importance/Relevance
