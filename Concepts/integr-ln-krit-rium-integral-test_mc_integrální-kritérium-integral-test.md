# Integrální kritérium (Integral test)

## Summary
The Integral Test is a convergence criterion for series. If $f$ is a non-increasing function on $(k_0, +\infty)$ and $f(k) = |a_k|$, then the series $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely if and only if the improper integral $\int_{k_0}^{\infty} f(x)dx$ converges.

## Detailed Explanation
The Integral Test provides a powerful tool for determining the convergence or divergence of infinite series by relating them to improper integrals.

### Definition
*   **From Lecture "Mathematical Analysis: Integrals, Series, and Numerical Methods" (ID: lec_0a0dc037-8067-470a-8948-277889b1ab2d):**
    If $f$ is a non-increasing function on $(k_0, +\infty)$ and $f(k) = |a_k|$, then $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely if and only if $\int_{k_0}^{\infty} f(x)dx$ converges.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, the Integral Test is an important criterion in the study of infinite series, offering a direct link between series convergence and integral convergence, particularly useful for series whose terms can be related to a continuous, non-increasing function.
