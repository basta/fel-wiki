## Summary
An (infinite) sequence of real numbers is a mapping from the natural numbers N to the real numbers R, denoted (a_n)_{n=1}^∞, where a_n is the n-th term.

## Detailed Explanation
An (infinite) sequence of real numbers is formally defined as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ (or sometimes a subset of integers starting from 0 or 1) and whose codomain is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. This mapping assigns a real number $a_n$ to each natural number $n$.

It is commonly denoted as $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$, where $a_n$ represents the $n$-th term of the sequence. For example, in the sequence $(1, 2, 3, \ldots)$, $a_n = n$. In the sequence $(1, 1/2, 1/3, \ldots)$, $a_n = 1/n$.
