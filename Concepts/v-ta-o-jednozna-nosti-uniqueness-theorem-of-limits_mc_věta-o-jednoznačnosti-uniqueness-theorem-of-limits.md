# Věta o jednoznačnosti (Uniqueness Theorem of Limits)

## Summary
A function has at most one limit at any given point.

## Detailed Explanation
The Uniqueness Theorem of Limits states that if a function approaches a limit at a certain point, then that limit must be unique. In other words, a function cannot approach two different values simultaneously as its input approaches a single point.

**Definition:**
"A function has at most one limit at any given point." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

This theorem is foundational because it ensures that limits, when they exist, are well-defined and unambiguous. Without this property, the concept of a limit would lose much of its mathematical utility.

## Importance/Relevance
This theorem is moderately important in mathematical analysis (importance score: 0.7 out of 1.0) as it establishes a fundamental property of limits, ensuring their consistent definition and application throughout calculus.
