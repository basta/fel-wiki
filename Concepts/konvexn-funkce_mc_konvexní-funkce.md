# Konvexní funkce

## Summary
A function f is convex on an interval I if for any x < y < z in I, the slope of the secant line from x to y is less than or equal to the slope of the secant line from y to z, i.e., (f(y)-f(x))/(y-x) ≤ (f(z)-f(y))/(z-y). If f is continuous on I and f''(x) ≥ 0, then f is convex on I.

## Detailed Explanation
* A function $f$ is convex on an interval $I$ if for any $x < y < z$ in $I$, the slope of the secant line from $x$ to $y$ is less than or equal to the slope of the secant line from $y$ to $z$, i.e., $\frac{f(y)-f(x)}{y-x} \leq \frac{f(z)-f(y)}{z-y}$. If $f$ is continuous on $I$ and $f''(x) \geq 0$, then $f$ is convex on $I$. (Source: Calculus: Derivatives, Functions, Sequences, and Integrals)
