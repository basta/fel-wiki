# Big Theta notation (Θ(g))

## Summary
A function f is said to be in the class Θ(g) for x approaching a if there exist constants m, M > 0 such that m|g(x)| ≤ |f(x)| ≤ M |g(x)| in a punctured neighborhood of a. It describes a tight bound on function growth.

## Detailed Explanation
* Definition from lec-math-2023-001: A function f is said to be in the class Θ(g) for x approaching a if there exist constants m, M > 0 such that $m|g(x)| \leq |f(x)| \leq M |g(x)|$ in a punctured neighborhood of a. It describes a tight bound on function growth.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an overall importance score of 0.9, indicating its high significance in understanding the tight bounds on function growth, particularly in asymptotic analysis.
