# Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem (o přírůstku funkce)

## Summary
If ƒ is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that ƒ(b) - ƒ(a) = ƒ'(c) · (b - a).

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition 1
If ƒ is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that ƒ(b) - ƒ(a) = ƒ'(c) · (b - a).
