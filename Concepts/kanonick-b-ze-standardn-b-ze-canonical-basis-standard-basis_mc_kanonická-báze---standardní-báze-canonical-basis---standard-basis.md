# Kanonická báze / Standardní báze (Canonical Basis / Standard Basis)

## Summary
For any field F, the ordered basis $K_n = (e_1, ..., e_n)$ for $F^n$, where $e_i$ has 1 in the i-th position and zeros elsewhere, is called the canonical or standard basis.

## Detailed Explanation
According to Báze a dimense:
For any field F, the ordered basis $K_n = (e_1, ..., e_n)$ for $F^n$, where $e_i$ has 1 in the i-th position and zeros elsewhere, is called the canonical or standard basis.

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is very important in linear algebra as it provides a fundamental and universally recognized basis for vector spaces like $F^n$.
