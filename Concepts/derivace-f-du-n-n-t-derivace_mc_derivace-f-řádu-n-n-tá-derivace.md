# Derivace f řádu n (n-tá derivace)

## Summary
The n-th derivative of a function $f$ is defined recursively: $f^{(0)} = f$ and $f^{(n)} = (f^{(n-1)})'$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This describes successive differentiation.

## Detailed Explanation
The n-th derivative of a function extends the concept of differentiation to higher orders. While the first derivative gives the rate of change and the second derivative describes concavity, the n-th derivative generalizes this idea to successive applications of the differentiation operator.

**Definition:**
*   The n-th derivative of a function $f$ is defined recursively: $f^{(0)} = f$ and $f^{(n)} = (f^{(n-1)})'$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This describes successive differentiation.

## Importance/Relevance
Understanding the n-th derivative is important (score: 0.8/1.0) as it is fundamental for advanced calculus topics, including Taylor series expansions, solving differential equations, and in physics for describing higher-order rates of change (e.g., jerk, snap, etc.).
