## Summary
The mean value (or average value) of a function $f$ over an interval $(a, b)$ is defined as the definite integral of the function over that interval, divided by the length of the interval. Mathematically, it is expressed as $\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x)dx$, assuming the integral converges. For a function that is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that the function must attain this mean value at some point within that interval.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of the mean value of a function is an extension of the idea of an average for a finite set of numbers to an infinite set of values represented by a continuous function. It provides a single representative value for the function's behavior over a given interval.

### Definition:
*   **Definition 1:** For a function $f$ defined on an interval $(a, b)$, its mean value (or average value) is given by:
    $$ \text{Mean Value} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x)dx $$
    This definition applies provided that the integral $\int_a^b f(x)dx$ converges. An important related theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, states that if $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in $[a, b]$ such that $f(c)$ equals the mean value of the function over the interval. This means a continuous function always "hits" its average value.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of medium-high importance (overall importance score: 0.7) as it bridges the discrete concept of average with continuous functions. It has applications in various fields, such as physics (e.g., average velocity), engineering (e.g., average power), and probability (e.g., expected value of a continuous random variable).
