# Lineární obal (span)

## Summary
The set of all possible linear combinations of a given set of vectors. It forms a subspace.

## Detailed Explanation
The linear span of a set of vectors is defined as the collection of all vectors that can be formed by taking linear combinations of the given vectors. This means taking each vector, multiplying it by a scalar, and adding the results together. A key property of the linear span is that it always forms a subspace.
