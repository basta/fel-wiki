# Dimense (Dimension)

## Summary
A linear space L has dimension n (denoted dim(L) = n) if there exists a basis B of L with n elements, where n is a natural number.

## Detailed Explanation
According to Báze a dimense:
A linear space $L$ has dimension $n$ (denoted $\text{dim}(L) = n$) if there exists a basis $B$ of $L$ with $n$ elements, where $n$ is a natural number.

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is extremely fundamental to linear algebra, defining a key property of vector spaces and being crucial for understanding their structure.
