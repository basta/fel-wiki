# Koeficienty lineární kombinace (Coefficients of a Linear Combination)

## Summary
The "coefficients of a linear combination" refer to the scalar values used to multiply individual vectors within a linear combination expression, typically written as $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \dots + a_nx_n$.

## Detailed Explanation
When forming a linear combination of vectors, we take a set of vectors $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ from a linear space and multiply each of them by a scalar from the underlying field. These scalar multipliers are precisely what are called the coefficients of the linear combination.

**Definition:**
*   From Lecture "Lineární prostory nad F" (`01B-2024-linear-spaces-over-F`):
    The scalars $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ used in a linear combination $a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n$.

For example, in the expression $3v_1 - 2v_2 + 0.5v_3$, the vectors are $v_1, v_2, v_3$, and the coefficients of this linear combination are $3, -2,$ and $0.5$.

## Key Aspects
*   **Scalars:** Coefficients are always scalars (elements from the field over which the linear space is defined, e.g., real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ or complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$).
*   **Multipliers:** They act as multipliers for the vectors in the combination.
*   **Uniqueness (in certain contexts):** In a basis, the coefficients of a vector's linear combination are unique.

## Importance/Relevance
With an `overallImportanceScore` of 0.6, coefficients are a foundational term in linear algebra. They are essential for defining and understanding core concepts such as:
*   Linear independence/dependence of vectors.
*   Spanning sets and bases.
*   Coordinates of a vector with respect to a basis.
*   Representing vectors and transformations.
