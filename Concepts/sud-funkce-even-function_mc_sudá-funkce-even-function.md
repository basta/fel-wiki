# sudá funkce (Even Function)

## Summary
A function $f$ is even if $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.

## Detailed Explanation
A **sudá funkce** (or **even function**) is a type of function that exhibits symmetry about the y-axis. The defining characteristic of an even function is that its output value remains the same when the input value is replaced by its negative counterpart.

Mathematically, a function $f(x)$ is even if for every $x$ in its domain, $-x$ is also in its domain, and the following condition holds:
$$ f(-x) = f(x) $$
Examples of even functions include $f(x) = x^2$, $f(x) = \cos(x)$, and $f(x) = |x|$. If you graph an even function, you'll notice that the part of the graph to the left of the y-axis is a mirror image of the part to the right of the y-axis.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of moderate importance (score: 0.6) primarily in calculus and Fourier analysis. Recognizing even functions can simplify computations, such as definite integrals over symmetric intervals, and is crucial for understanding symmetry in signals and periodic phenomena.
