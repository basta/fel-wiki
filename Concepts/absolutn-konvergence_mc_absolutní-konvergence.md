# Absolutn√≠ konvergence

## Summary
A series $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely if the series of its absolute values, $\sum |a_k|$, converges. A crucial property is that an absolutely convergent series always converges.

## Detailed Explanation
Absolute convergence is a stronger form of convergence than conditional convergence.
*   **Definition:** A series $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely if the series of its absolute values, $\sum |a_k|$, converges.

A key theorem states that **if a series converges absolutely, then it also converges.** This means that if $\sum |a_k|$ converges, then $\sum a_k$ also converges. The converse is not true; a series can converge without converging absolutely (this is called conditional convergence). An example of a conditionally convergent series is the alternating harmonic series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}$, which converges but its series of absolute values (the harmonic series) diverges.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of **high importance** (score: 0.8) as it defines a powerful type of convergence that simplifies analysis (as absolute convergence implies convergence) and is often easier to test for using other criteria like the Ratio Test or Root Test. Understanding absolute convergence is crucial for advanced topics like power series and Fourier series.
