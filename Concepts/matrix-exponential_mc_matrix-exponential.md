# Matrix Exponential

## Summary
For a square matrix X, the matrix exponential $e^X$ (or $\text{exp}(X)$) is defined by the power series $\Sigma (X^n / n!)$ from $n=0$ to infinity. It is used to solve systems of linear differential equations.

## Detailed Explanation
The matrix exponential for a square matrix $X$ is formally defined by the infinite power series, analogous to the scalar exponential function:
$$
e^X = \text{exp}(X) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{X^n}{n!} = I + X + \frac{X^2}{2!} + \frac{X^3}{3!} + \dots
$$
This definition is fundamental in various areas of mathematics and physics, particularly for solving systems of linear differential equations.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, the Matrix Exponential is a significant mathematical function, particularly for its role in the analytical solutions of linear ordinary differential equations.
