# vzájemně jednoznačná (Bijection)

## Summary
A function that is both injective (prostá) and surjective (na).

## Detailed Explanation
A function is defined as **vzájemně jednoznačná** (or a **bijection**) if it satisfies two key properties simultaneously: it must be **injective** (prostá) and **surjective** (na).
*   **Injective (One-to-one)**: Each element in the codomain is mapped by at most one element from the domain. No two distinct inputs map to the same output.
*   **Surjective (Onto)**: Every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one element from the domain. The entire codomain is covered by the function's range.

When a function is both injective and surjective, it establishes a perfect one-to-one correspondence between its domain and codomain. This means that for every element in the codomain, there is exactly one unique element in the domain that maps to it.

*   **Definition from "Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis"**: A function that is both injective (prostá) and surjective (na).

## Importance/Relevance
This concept holds moderate importance (score: 0.7) as bijections are crucial for establishing equivalences between sets, defining invertible functions, and are foundational in many areas of mathematics including set theory, abstract algebra, and topology.
