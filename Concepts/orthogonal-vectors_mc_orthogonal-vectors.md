# Orthogonal Vectors

## Summary
Vectors $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal (or mutually perpendicular) if their scalar product $(x | y) = 0$.

## Detailed Explanation
Two vectors, $x$ and $y$, are defined as orthogonal if their scalar product (also known as dot product or inner product) is equal to zero. This condition, $(x | y) = 0$, implies that the vectors are "mutually perpendicular" in a geometric sense.

In Euclidean space, this corresponds to the intuitive notion of two lines or segments being at a 90-degree angle to each other. The concept of orthogonality extends to more abstract vector spaces where the "angle" is defined purely by the scalar product.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.8, orthogonal vectors are a cornerstone concept in linear algebra, geometry, and many areas of applied mathematics and engineering. They are crucial for simplifying calculations, constructing bases, and understanding projections.
