# Triviální lineární kombinace

## Summary
A linear combination $a_1 \cdot x_1 + \dots + a_n \cdot x_n$ is trivial if all coefficients $a_1, \dots, a_n$ are equal to 0. A trivial linear combination is always equal to the zero vector.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of a trivial linear combination is a specific instance of a linear combination where all scalar coefficients are zero. This specific case is important because it always results in the zero vector, and its properties are often used to define concepts like linear independence.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (from Lecture "Lineární závislost a nezávislost"):** "A linear combination $a_1 \cdot x_1 + \dots + a_n \cdot x_n$ is trivial if all coefficients $a_1, \dots, a_n$ are equal to 0."
*   **Definition 2 (from Lecture "Lineární závislost a nezávislost"):** "A trivial linear combination is always equal to the zero vector."

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is highly important (Importance Score: 0.8) particularly in the context of defining and understanding linear independence. It provides a baseline case for linear combinations.
