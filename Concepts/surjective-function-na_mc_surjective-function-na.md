# Surjective Function (na)

## Summary
A function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain (codomain equals range).

## Detailed Explanation
A surjective function, also known as an "onto" function, means that the range of the function is equal to its codomain. In simpler terms, for every element $y$ in the codomain, there exists at least one element $x$ in the domain such that $f(x) = y$. No element in the codomain is "left out" without an arrow pointing to it from the domain.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** A function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain (codomain equals range).

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of moderate importance (score: 0.7) in mathematics, particularly in areas like set theory and linear algebra, as it describes a fundamental property of how functions cover their target sets.
