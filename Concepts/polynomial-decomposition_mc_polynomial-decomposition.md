# Polynomial decomposition

## Summary
Polynomial decomposition refers to the unique factorization of a non-zero polynomial into its linear and irreducible quadratic factors, which can be represented in a general form such as $a(x-a_1)^{k_1}...(x^2+p_1x+q_1)^{l_1}...$.

## Detailed Explanation
This concept is a cornerstone of algebra, asserting that any non-zero polynomial with real coefficients can be uniquely factored into specific types of simpler polynomial terms. This factorization is fundamental for understanding the roots of polynomials and for applying techniques like partial fraction decomposition in calculus.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from Integral Calculus: Formulas, Theorems, and Applications:** The unique factorization of a non-zero polynomial into linear and irreducible quadratic factors, such as $a(x-a_1)^{k_1}...(x^2+p_1x+q_1)^{l_1}...$.
