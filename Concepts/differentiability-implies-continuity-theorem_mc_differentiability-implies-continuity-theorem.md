# Differentiability Implies Continuity Theorem

## Summary
If a function has a derivative at a point, then it is continuous at that point.

## Detailed Explanation
This theorem establishes a fundamental relationship between differentiability and continuity. It states that if a function is "smooth enough" to have a well-defined derivative at a specific point, it must also be continuous at that point. In simpler terms, you can't have a tangent line at a point where the function has a break or a jump. The converse, however, is not true: a function can be continuous but not differentiable (e.g., at a sharp corner or cusp).

**Definition:**
*   From `calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01`: "If a function has a derivative at a point, then it is continuous at that point."
