# Taylorův polynom f v a řádu n ($T_n(x)$)

## Summary
A polynomial approximation of a function $f$ around a point '$a$' up to degree $n$, derived from the function's derivatives at '$a$'.

## Detailed Explanation
The Taylor polynomial of a function $f$ at a point $a$ of order $n$ is a finite sum that serves as a polynomial approximation of the function $f$ near the point $a$. It is constructed using the function's value and its first $n$ derivatives, all evaluated at the point $a$.

**Definition:**
*   A polynomial approximation of a function $f$ around a point '$a$' up to degree $n$, derived from the function's derivatives at '$a$'.

The general form of the Taylor polynomial of order $n$ for a function $f$ about $x=a$ is given by:
$$ T_n(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \dots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n $$

## Importance/Relevance
Taylor polynomials are important (score: 0.8/1.0) tools in numerical analysis and applied mathematics. They allow us to approximate complicated functions with simpler polynomials, which are easier to work with for calculations, integrations, and solving equations. They are the building blocks of Taylor series.
