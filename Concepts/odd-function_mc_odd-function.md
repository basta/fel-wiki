# Odd Function

## Summary
An odd function ƒ is defined by the property that ƒ(-x) = -ƒ(x) for all x in its domain.

## Detailed Explanation
The definition of an odd function is given as:
*   A function ƒ where ƒ(-x) = -ƒ(x) for all x in its domain. (Source: calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01)

This means that if you input '-x' into the function, the output is the negative of the output for 'x'. Graphically, the graph of an odd function is symmetric with respect to the origin.

## Importance/Relevance
This is an important concept for classifying functions and is useful in simplifying computations, especially in areas like Fourier series and integral transforms.
