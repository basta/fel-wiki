# Newtonovy-Cotesovy metody (Newton-Cotes methods)

## Summary
Newton-Cotes methods are a family of numerical integration formulas based on equidistant divisions, employing optimal weights. They include closed forms (where endpoints $a, b$ are considered) and open forms (where endpoints $a, b$ are not considered).

## Detailed Explanation
Newton-Cotes formulas are a group of methods used for numerical integration (also known as quadrature). They approximate the definite integral of a function by approximating the function with a polynomial that passes through equally spaced points. These methods are widely used due to their straightforward implementation.
