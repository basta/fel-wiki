# Laplaceova transformace (Laplace Transform)

## Summary
The Laplace Transform of a function f(t) is defined as F(p) = ∫₀⁺∞ f(t)e⁻ᵖᵗ dt, for f(t): (0,+∞) → R piecewise continuous, with |f(t)| ≤ M eᵃᵗ.

## Detailed Explanation
The Laplace Transform is an integral transform widely used to solve linear differential equations with constant coefficients. It transforms a function of a real variable $t$ (often time) to a function of a complex variable $p$ (frequency). This transformation simplifies many problems by converting differential equations into algebraic equations, which are often much easier to solve.

The formal definition for the Laplace Transform of a function $f(t)$ is given by:
$$ F(p) = \int_0^{+\infty} f(t)e^{-pt} dt $$
This definition applies to functions $f(t)$ that are piecewise continuous on $(0, +\infty)$ and whose growth is restricted by an exponential bound, i.e., $|f(t)| \leq M e^{at}$ for some constants $M$ and $a$. The parameter $p$ is generally a complex number.
