# Lichoběžníková metoda (Trapezoidal Rule)

## Summary
A numerical integration method that approximates the area under a curve by integrating linear interpolation (trapezoids) over subintervals.

## Detailed Explanation
The Trapezoidal Rule is a numerical integration method designed to approximate the definite integral of a function. As defined, it approximates the area under a curve by integrating linear interpolation. This means that within each subinterval, the function is approximated by a straight line segment connecting the function's values at the endpoints of that subinterval. This forms a trapezoid whose area can be easily calculated. The sum of the areas of all these trapezoids across the entire interval provides an approximation of the total area under the curve, hence the definite integral.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an importance score of 0.6. It is a fundamental and relatively simple numerical method for approximating integrals, useful when analytical solutions are not feasible or computationally intensive.
