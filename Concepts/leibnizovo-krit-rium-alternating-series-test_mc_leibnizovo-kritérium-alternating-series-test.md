# Leibnizovo krit√©rium (Alternating Series Test)

## Summary
The Leibniz Criterion, also known as the Alternating Series Test, states that for an alternating series of the form $\sum (-1)^{k-1}b_k$ or $\sum a_k$, if the sequence of absolute values $(|b_k|)$ or $(|a_k|)$ is non-increasing and its limit approaches zero, then the series converges.

## Detailed Explanation
The Alternating Series Test is specifically designed to determine the convergence of series where terms alternate in sign.

### Definition
*   **From Lecture "Mathematical Analysis: Integrals, Series, and Numerical Methods" (ID: lec_0a0dc037-8067-470a-8948-277889b1ab2d):**
    For an alternating series $\sum (-1)^{k-1}b_k$ or $\sum a_k$, if the sequence $(|b_k|)$ or $(|a_k|)$ is non-increasing and its limit is zero, the series converges.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.8, the Leibniz Criterion is a highly significant tool for analyzing the convergence of alternating series, providing a straightforward condition for their convergence.
