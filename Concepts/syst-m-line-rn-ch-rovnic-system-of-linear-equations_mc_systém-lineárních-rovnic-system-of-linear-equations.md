# Systém lineárních rovnic (System of Linear Equations)

## Summary
A set of linear equations, which can be represented in matrix form as A·x = b. The number of columns in matrix A corresponds to the number of unknowns, and the number of rows corresponds to the number of equations in the system.

## Detailed Explanation
A system of linear equations is fundamentally a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. These systems are pervasive in mathematics, engineering, and science, used to model diverse phenomena from economic models to physical systems.

### Definition:
A set of linear equations, which can be represented in matrix form as $A \cdot x = b$. The number of columns in matrix $A$ corresponds to the number of unknowns, and the number of rows corresponds to the number of equations in the system.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly significant (overall importance score of 0.8) in linear algebra and various scientific and engineering fields, as many real-world problems can be modeled and solved using systems of linear equations. Understanding these systems is foundational for further study in areas like optimization, differential equations, and data analysis.
