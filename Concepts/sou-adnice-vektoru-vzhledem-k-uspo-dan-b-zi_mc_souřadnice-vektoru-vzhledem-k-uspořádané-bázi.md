# Souřadnice vektoru vzhledem k uspořádané bázi

## Summary
For a linear space L with an ordered basis B = (b₁,..., bn), any vector x in L can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination x = a₁ · b₁ + … + an · bn. The list (a1, ..., an) is called the coordinates of vector x with respect to the ordered basis B, denoted as coordB(x).

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of coordinates relative to an ordered basis is fundamental in linear algebra, allowing us to represent abstract vectors as concrete lists of numbers (coordinate vectors). This representation is unique for a given ordered basis, which is crucial for performing computations and gaining a deeper understanding of vector spaces.

### Definition:
For a linear space $L$ with an ordered basis $B = (b_1,..., b_n)$, any vector $x$ in $L$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination $x = a_1 \cdot b_1 + \dots + a_n \cdot b_n$. The list $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ is called the coordinates of vector $x$ with respect to the ordered basis $B$, denoted as $coord_B(x)$.

## Importance/Relevance
This is a crucial concept with an overall importance score of 0.9, as it provides the mechanism to translate abstract vector operations into concrete coordinate operations. This ability to work with coordinate vectors enables practical calculations and bridges abstract vector spaces with familiar coordinate spaces like $R^n$.
