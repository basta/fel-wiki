# Data Compression (using SVD)

## Summary
The ability to approximate a matrix (e.g., an image) by using a reduced number of singular values, which saves storage space while retaining significant information.

## Detailed Explanation
**Definition (from svd-pseudoinverse-lecture):** The ability to approximate a matrix (e.g., an image) by using a reduced number of singular values, which saves storage space while retaining significant information.

## Importance/Relevance
Data compression using SVD is an important application, enabling efficient storage and processing of large datasets like images by retaining significant information while reducing size.
