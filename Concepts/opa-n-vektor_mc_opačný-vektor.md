# Opačný vektor

## Summary
The opposite vector of a vector $x$ is denoted as $-x$, which is effectively $(-1)x$.

## Detailed Explanation
In vector spaces, for every vector $x$, there exists an additive inverse, often called the opposite vector. This vector, when added to $x$, results in the zero vector. It's commonly represented as $-x$. The definition clarifies that this is effectively the scalar multiplication of the vector $x$ by the scalar $-1$.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from Lecture "Lineární obal a lineární podprostor" (ID: lec_405d2298-d6a0-4f9e-aa9f-6ca3f176cd57):**
    "-x místo (-1)x."

## Importance/Relevance
With an importance score of 0.4, the opposite vector is a basic property within vector spaces, essential for understanding vector addition and the existence of an additive identity (the zero vector). It's a fundamental concept in defining vector space axioms.
