# Invertibilita matice

## Summary
Invertibilita matice je vlastnost, kdy matice A je regulární (invertibilní) právě tehdy, když její determinant det(A) je nenulový, tj. det(A) ≠ 0.

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition
According to the lecture "Determinant: část 1" (ID: 07A-2024-Determinant-Part-1):
> Matice A je regulární (invertibilní) právě tehdy, když její determinant det(A) je nenulový (det(A) ≠ 0).

This definition establishes a crucial link between the determinant of a square matrix and its invertibility. A square matrix is considered **invertible** (or **regular**) if there exists another matrix, called its inverse, such that their product is the identity matrix. This property is fundamental in linear algebra, as invertible matrices correspond to linear transformations that are one-to-one and onto, meaning they preserve all information and can be "undone." The determinant provides a simple and direct test for this property: if det(A) = 0, the matrix is **singular** (not invertible).

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly relevant as it provides a fundamental criterion for determining if a matrix has an inverse, which is critical for solving systems of linear equations, understanding linear transformations, and many other applications in mathematics and engineering.
