# Skalární součin

## Summary
A binary operation that takes two vectors as input and produces a scalar quantity. In $\mathbb{R}^n$, it can be defined by a positive definite matrix $G$ as $x^T G y$.

## Detailed Explanation
The scalar product, also known as the dot product, is a key operation in vector algebra that provides a way to multiply two vectors to get a scalar. This scalar quantity has significant geometric interpretations, such as determining the angle between vectors or projecting one vector onto another.
