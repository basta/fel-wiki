# Choleskyho faktorisace

## Summary
A decomposition of a positive definite matrix $G$ into the product $G = R^T R$, where $R$ is an upper triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries.

## Detailed Explanation
Cholesky decomposition is a powerful method for decomposing a positive definite matrix into the product of an upper triangular matrix and its transpose. This factorization is particularly useful because it is numerically stable and computationally efficient.

**Definition:**
*   **From linear-algebra-scalar-products-Rn:** Cholesky factorization is defined as "A decomposition of a positive definite matrix $G$ into the product $G = R^T R$, where $R$ is an upper triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries."

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, Cholesky Factorization is a moderately important algorithm, highly valued for its applications in solving linear equations, Monte Carlo simulations, and Kalman filters.
