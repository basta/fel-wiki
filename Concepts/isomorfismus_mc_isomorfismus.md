# Isomorfismus

## Summary
A linear transformation f is an isomorphism if it is bijective (both injective and surjective). Equivalently, an inverse linear transformation f⁻¹ exists.

## Detailed Explanation
*   A linear transformation f is an isomorphism if it is bijective (both injective and surjective). Equivalently, an inverse linear transformation f⁻¹ exists. (Source: 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2)
