## Summary
A function f is concave on an interval I if it satisfies the opposite inequality for convex functions, or if f is continuous on I and f''(x) ≤ 0, then f is concave on I.

## Detailed Explanation
A function $f$ is considered concave on an interval $I$ if it satisfies the opposite inequality for convex functions. Alternatively, if $f$ is continuous on $I$ and its second derivative $f''(x) \le 0$ for all $x$ in $I$, then $f$ is concave on $I$.
