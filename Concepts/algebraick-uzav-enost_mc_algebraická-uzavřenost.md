# Algebraická uzavřenost

## Summary
A property of a field (like C) where every non-constant polynomial with coefficients in that field has at least one root in that field. Consequently, every polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots (counted with multiplicities) in an algebraically closed field.

## Detailed Explanation
Algebraická uzavřenost (Algebraic Closure) describes a property of a field where all non-constant polynomials, whose coefficients belong to that field, possess at least one root within the same field. This fundamental property implies that for any polynomial of degree $n$, there will be exactly $n$ roots (when counted with their multiplicities) present in an algebraically closed field. The field of complex numbers (C) is a prime example of an algebraically closed field, as stated by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important in mathematics (score: 0.7), particularly in algebra and complex analysis, as it guarantees the existence of roots for polynomials, which is crucial for solving equations and understanding algebraic structures.
