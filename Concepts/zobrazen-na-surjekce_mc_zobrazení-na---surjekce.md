# Zobrazení na / Surjekce

## Summary
A mapping f : X -> Y is surjective (or onto) if for every element y in the codomain Y, there exists at least one element x in the domain X such that f(x) = y.

## Detailed Explanation
A **surjective mapping** (also known as an **onto function** or **zobrazení na**) is a type of function where every element in the codomain $Y$ is "hit" by at least one element from the domain $X$. In other words, the image of the function is equal to its codomain.

### Definition
According to the provided definition from lecture "Souřadnice vzhledem k uspořádané bázi a komutativní diagramy":
"A mapping $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is surjective (or onto) if for every element $y$ in the codomain $Y$, there exists at least one element $x$ in the domain $X$ such that $f(x) = y$."

This means that for any possible output value $y$ that is part of the codomain, there is at least one input value $x$ in the domain that maps to it. No element in the codomain is left out.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (Importance Score: 0.8) as it helps to characterize functions based on their range relative to their codomain. Surjective functions are fundamental in understanding quotient spaces, epimorphisms in category theory, and the existence of solutions in systems of equations.
