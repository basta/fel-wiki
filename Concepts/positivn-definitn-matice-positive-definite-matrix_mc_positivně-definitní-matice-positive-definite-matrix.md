# Positivně definitní matice (Positive Definite Matrix)

## Summary

A Positive Definite Matrix is a type of matrix that defines scalar products in $\mathbb{R}^n$. They are implicitly understood as the matrices $G$ that establish these scalar products.

## Detailed Explanation

In linear algebra, scalar products (also known as inner products) are fundamental for defining geometric concepts like length and angle in a vector space. A positive definite matrix plays a crucial role in defining these products.

**Definition:**
*   Matrices that define scalar products in $\mathbb{R}^n$. (Implicitly defined as the matrices $G$ that define scalar products). This definition comes from the lecture "Abstraktní skalární součin".

For a symmetric matrix $A$, it is positive definite if for all non-zero vectors $x$, the quadratic form $x^T A x > 0$. This property ensures that the "length" of any non-zero vector defined by the scalar product is always positive.

## Importance

With an overall importance score of 0.7, Positive Definite Matrices are a significant concept in linear algebra, essential for understanding inner product spaces, optimization, and various applications in mathematics and engineering.

## Connections
