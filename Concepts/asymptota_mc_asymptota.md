# Asymptota

## Summary
A line that a curve approaches as it heads towards infinity. This includes vertical asymptotes ($x=a$) and oblique asymptotes ($y=px+q$).

## Detailed Explanation
An asymptote is a line that a curve gets arbitrarily close to as one or both of the independent or dependent variables tend towards infinity. Asymptotes are crucial for understanding the long-term behavior of functions and for sketching their graphs. The definition provided specifically highlights two types:

*   **Vertical Asymptotes:** These are vertical lines, typically of the form $x=a$, that the function approaches as $x$ gets closer to $a$, causing the function's value to tend towards positive or negative infinity.
*   **Oblique (or Slant) Asymptotes:** These are non-horizontal lines, typically of the form $y=px+q$, that the function approaches as $x$ tends towards positive or negative infinity.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (Source: MA-Lec-001):** A line that a curve approaches as it heads towards infinity. This includes vertical asymptotes ($x=a$) and oblique asymptotes ($y=px+q$).

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is important for analyzing the behavior of functions at their boundaries and for graphing functions, especially rational functions. It has an overall importance score of 0.7.
