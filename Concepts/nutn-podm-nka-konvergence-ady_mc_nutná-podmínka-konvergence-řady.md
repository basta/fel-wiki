## Summary
The Necessary Condition for Convergence of a Series states that if a series $\sum a_k$ converges, then the limit of its terms must be zero ($\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0$).

## Detailed Explanation
The fundamental definition of the Necessary Condition for Convergence of a Series is:
*   **Definition:** If a series $\sum a_k$ converges, then the limit of its terms must be zero ($\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0$).
    *   *Source:* Mathematical Analysis: Integrals, Series, and Numerical Methods (lec_0a0dc037-8067-470a-8948-277889b1ab2d)

This condition is *necessary* but not *sufficient*. This means that if the limit of the terms is not zero, the series *must* diverge. However, if the limit of the terms *is* zero, the series might still diverge (e.g., the harmonic series $\sum \frac{1}{k}$). For instance, the harmonic series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}$ has $\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{1}{k} = 0$, but the series diverges.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of **high importance** (score: 0.8) as it provides a quick preliminary test for divergence. If this condition is not met, there's no need to apply more complex convergence tests, as the series is guaranteed to diverge.
