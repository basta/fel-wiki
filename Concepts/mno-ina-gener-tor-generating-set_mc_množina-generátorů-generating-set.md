# Množina generátorů (Generating Set)

## Summary
For a linear subspace $W$ of $L$, a set $G$ generates $W$ if $span(G) = W$. It is also referred to as a set of generators for subspace $W$.

## Detailed Explanation
A **generating set** (or set of generators) for a linear subspace is a collection of vectors whose linear combinations can produce every vector within that subspace. It defines the "reach" of a set of vectors through vector addition and scalar multiplication.

In formal terms, if $W$ is a linear subspace of a vector space $L$, and $G$ is a set of vectors within $L$, then $G$ is a generating set for $W$ if the **span of $G$**, denoted $span(G)$, is equal to $W$. The span of a set of vectors $G$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $G$.

This means that any vector $w \in W$ can be expressed as $w = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \dots + c_kv_k$ for some scalars $c_i$ and vectors $v_i \in G$.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is important (Overall Importance Score: 0.8) as it is fundamental to understanding the structure of vector spaces and subspaces. Generating sets are a precursor to defining a basis, which is a minimal generating set. They help in describing subspaces concisely.
