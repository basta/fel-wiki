# Nekonečná číselná řada (Infinite numerical series)

## Summary
An infinite numerical series is an expression $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k = a_1+a_2+\dots$, where $(a_k)_{k=1}^\infty$ is a sequence of numbers. $a_k$ is the k-th term.

## Detailed Explanation
An infinite numerical series represents the sum of infinitely many terms from a sequence of numbers. It is formally expressed as:

$$ \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \dots $$

Here, $(a_k)_{k=1}^\infty$ denotes a sequence of numbers, and $a_k$ is referred to as the k-th term of the series. The ellipsis ($\dots$) indicates that the sum continues indefinitely.

## Importance and Relevance
This concept is of **high importance** (score: 0.9) in mathematics, particularly in calculus and analysis, as it forms the foundation for understanding convergence, divergence, and the behavior of functions through series representations (e.g., Taylor series).
