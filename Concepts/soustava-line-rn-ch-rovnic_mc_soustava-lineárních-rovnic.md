# Soustava lineárních rovnic (System of Linear Equations)

## Summary
A system of linear equations, typically represented in matrix form A x = b.

## Detailed Explanation
A system of linear equations is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. The goal is often to find values for these variables that simultaneously satisfy all equations in the system.

*   A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable. The exponents of the variables are always 1.
*   These systems are fundamental in mathematics and have widespread applications across science, engineering, economics, and computer science.
*   They can be compactly represented in matrix form: $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, where $A$ is the coefficient matrix, $\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of variables, and $\mathbf{b}$ is the constant vector.

**Definition:**
*   A system of linear equations, typically represented in matrix form A x = b. (Source: 06A-2024-GEM-LinearSystems-Part1)
