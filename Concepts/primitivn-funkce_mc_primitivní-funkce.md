# Primitivn√≠ funkce

## Summary
A function F is a primitive function (antiderivative) of a function f on an interval I if F' = f on I. Every continuous function on an interval has a primitive function.

## Detailed Explanation
A primitive function, also known as an antiderivative, is a fundamental concept in calculus. 
A function $F$ is defined as a primitive function of a function $f$ on an interval $I$ if the derivative of $F$ equals $f$ for all points in $I$. That is, $F'(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in I$. 
An important property is that every continuous function on an interval is guaranteed to have a primitive function.
