# One-Sided Limits

## Summary
One-sided limits refer to the behavior of a function as its input approaches a point specifically from either the left (values less than the point) or the right (values greater than the point). A function's overall limit exists if and only if both its left-hand limit and right-hand limit at that point exist and are equal.

## Detailed Explanation
The definition of one-sided limits states:
*   Limits from the left (zleva) or from the right (zprava) of a point. The limit of a function exists if and only if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. (Source: calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01)

A left-hand limit (often denoted as $\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$) describes the value the function approaches as $x$ gets closer to $a$ from values less than $a$.
A right-hand limit (often denoted as $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$) describes the value the function approaches as $x$ gets closer to $a$ from values greater than $a$.
The crucial implication is that for the general limit $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ to exist, these two directional limits must converge to the same value.

## Importance/Relevance
One-sided limits are a core principle in calculus, essential for a precise understanding of limits, particularly at points where a function might have a jump discontinuity or is defined piecewise. They are crucial for determining the existence of a full limit and for studying continuity.
