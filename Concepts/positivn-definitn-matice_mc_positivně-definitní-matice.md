# Positivně definitní matice

## Summary
A symmetric matrix $G$ for which $x^T G x > 0$ for all non-zero vectors $x$, or equivalently, a matrix $G$ for which there exists a matrix $R$ with linearly independent columns such that $G = R^T R$.

## Detailed Explanation
Positive definite matrices are a special class of symmetric matrices that play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics, especially in optimization, calculus, and linear algebra where they define valid scalar products and quadratic forms.

**Definitions:**
*   **From linear-algebra-scalar-products-Rn:** A symmetric matrix $G$ is positive definite if "$x^T G x > 0$ for all non-zero vectors $x$, or equivalently, a matrix $G$ for which there exists a matrix $R$ with linearly independent columns such that $G = R^T R$."
*   **From linear-algebra-scalar-products-Rn:** Equivalently, it is "a symmetric matrix where all leading principal minors (determinants of $G_k$ submatrices) are positive."

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.9, Positive Definite Matrices are a core principle, foundational for understanding and defining scalar products, quadratic forms, and ensuring convexity in optimization problems.
