# Jordan-Chevalley Decomposition

## Summary
Any square matrix over an algebraically closed field can be uniquely decomposed into a sum of a diagonalizable matrix (M_diag) and a nilpotent matrix (M_nil) that commute with each other.

## Detailed Explanation
As defined in lecture "Jordanův tvar" (ID: lec_0b7a9823-c557-4731-a7bd-cf65672dba4d), the Jordan-Chevalley Decomposition states:
*   Any square matrix over an algebraically closed field can be uniquely decomposed into a sum of a diagonalizable matrix ($M_{diag}$) and a nilpotent matrix ($M_{nil}$) that commute with each other.

## Importance
This concept holds very high importance in its field (Score: 0.9). The Jordan-Chevalley Decomposition is a fundamental theorem in linear algebra and Lie theory, providing a powerful tool for analyzing the structure of matrices and linear operators by separating their semisimple (diagonalizable) and nilpotent parts.
