# VÄ›ta o monotonii limit (Monotonicity Theorem for Limits)

## Summary
If $f(x) \le g(x)$ in a punctured neighborhood of $a$, and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = b$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = c$, then $b \le c$.

## Detailed Explanation
The Monotonicity Theorem for Limits provides a relationship between the limits of two functions if one function is consistently less than or equal to the other in a region around the point of interest.

**Definition:**
"If $f(x) \le g(x)$ in a punctured neighborhood of $a$, and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = b$ and $\lim_{x \to a} g(x) = c$, then $b \le c$." (Source: Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis)

This means that if one function's values are always below or equal to another function's values as they approach a certain point, then the limit of the first function will also be less than or equal to the limit of the second function at that point.

## Importance/Relevance
This theorem is moderately important in mathematical analysis (importance score: 0.7 out of 1.0). It is a useful tool for comparing limits and can be applied in proofs involving inequalities of functions and their limiting behaviors.
