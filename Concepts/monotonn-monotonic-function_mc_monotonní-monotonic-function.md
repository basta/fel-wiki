# monotonní (Monotonic Function)

## Summary
A function that is either consistently increasing (rostoucí), decreasing (klesající), non-decreasing (neklesající), or non-increasing (nerostoucí).

## Detailed Explanation
A **monotonní** (or **monotonic**) function is one that preserves a consistent trend in its output values as its input values increase. This means the function is either always going up, always going down, or staying flat, but never reversing its general direction.

There are four specific types of monotonic functions:

*   **Increasing (rostoucí)**: For any $x_1 < x_2$ in the domain, $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. The function strictly goes up.
*   **Decreasing (klesající)**: For any $x_1 < x_2$ in the domain, $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. The function strictly goes down.
*   **Non-decreasing (neklesající)**: For any $x_1 < x_2$ in the domain, $f(x_1) \le f(x_2)$. The function goes up or stays flat.
*   **Non-increasing (nerostoucí)**: For any $x_1 < x_2$ in the domain, $f(x_1) \ge f(x_2)$. The function goes down or stays flat.

Functions that are strictly increasing or strictly decreasing are sometimes referred to as "strictly monotonic."

*   **Definition from "Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis"**: A function that is either consistently increasing (rostoucí), decreasing (klesající), non-decreasing (neklesající), or non-increasing (nerostoucí).

## Importance/Relevance
Monotonic functions are highly important (score: 0.8) in mathematical analysis and calculus. Their properties are crucial for proving theorems related to convergence, integrability, differentiability, and for analyzing the behavior of sequences and series. They are also fundamental in optimization problems and economic models.
