# Pauliho matice

## Summary
A set of three 2x2 complex Hermitian and unitary matrices (X, Y, Z or σ1, σ2, σ3) fundamental in quantum mechanics and quantum computing, representing spin operators.

## Detailed Explanation
Pauliho matice (Pauli Matrices) are a specific set of three 2x2 matrices that are both Hermitian (equal to their own conjugate transpose) and unitary (their conjugate transpose is also their inverse). These matrices are denoted as X, Y, Z or equivalently as $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$. They are fundamental in quantum mechanics, where they are used to represent spin operators, and in quantum computing, serving as a basis for quantum gates.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of medium-high importance (score: 0.6), especially in the fields of quantum mechanics and quantum computing, where they form foundational elements for describing quantum states and operations.
