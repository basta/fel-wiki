# Geometrická řada (Geometric series)

## Summary
A geometric series is a series of the form $$ \sum_{k=1}^∞ a_1q^{k-1} = a_1+a_1q+a_1q^2+… $$.

## Detailed Explanation
A geometric series is a specific type of infinite series that plays a fundamental role in mathematics, particularly in calculus and analysis. Its terms follow a geometric progression, meaning each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

According to lecture lec-math-2023-001, a geometric series is defined as:
*   "A series of the form $$ \sum_{k=1}^∞ a_1q^{k-1} = a_1+a_1q+a_1q^2+… $$."
