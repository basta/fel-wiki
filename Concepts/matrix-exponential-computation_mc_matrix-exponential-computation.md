# Matrix Exponential Computation

## Summary
The matrix exponential $\text{exp}(tM)$ can be computed by decomposing $M$ into its diagonalizable ($M_{\text{diag}}$) and nilpotent ($M_{\text{nil}}$) parts. Since $M_{\text{diag}}$ and $M_{\text{nil}}$ commute, $\text{exp}(tM) = \text{exp}(tM_{\text{diag}}) \cdot \text{exp}(tM_{\text{nil}})$. The exponential of the diagonal part is straightforward, and the exponential of the nilpotent part is a finite sum (polynomial) because of nilpotency.

## Detailed Explanation
Computing the matrix exponential $e^{tM}$ for a general matrix $M$ is a non-trivial task. One effective method involves decomposing the matrix $M$ into two commuting parts:
1.  A **diagonalizable part** ($M_{\text{diag}}$)
2.  A **nilpotent part** ($M_{\text{nil}}$)

This decomposition is possible when working with matrices whose characteristic polynomial splits, for example, over the complex numbers (which is guaranteed for complex matrices or real matrices viewed as complex).
The key property exploited here is that if two matrices $A$ and $B$ commute (i.e., $AB = BA$), then $e^{A+B} = e^A e^B$.
Since $M_{\text{diag}}$ and $M_{\text{nil}}$ commute, we can write:
$$
e^{tM} = e^{t(M_{\text{diag}} + M_{\text{nil}})} = e^{tM_{\text{diag}}} e^{tM_{\text{nil}}}
$$
The computation then simplifies because:
*   **$e^{tM_{\text{diag}}}$:** If $M_{\text{diag}}$ is diagonal, its exponential is simply the exponential of its diagonal entries. If $M_{\text{diag}}$ is diagonalizable, it can be expressed as $P D P^{-1}$ where $D$ is diagonal, and then $e^{tM_{\text{diag}}} = P e^{tD} P^{-1}$.
*   **$e^{tM_{\text{nil}}}$:** Since $M_{\text{nil}}$ is nilpotent, there exists an integer $k$ such that $M_{\text{nil}}^k = 0$. This means the power series for $e^{tM_{\text{nil}}}$ becomes a finite sum (a polynomial in $tM_{\text{nil}}$), making its computation straightforward:
    $$
e^{tM_{\text{nil}}} = I + tM_{\text{nil}} + \frac{(tM_{\text{nil}})^2}{2!} + \dots + \frac{(tM_{\text{nil}})^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}
    $$
This method is particularly powerful as it breaks down a complex computation into manageable parts.
