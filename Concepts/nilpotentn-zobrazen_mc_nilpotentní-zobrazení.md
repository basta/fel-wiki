# Nilpotentní zobrazení

## Summary

A linear transformation $f$ is considered nilpotent if, when applied repeatedly, it eventually results in the zero transformation. Specifically, $f^k = o$ (the zero transformation) for some positive integer $k$.

## Detailed Explanation

Nilpotent transformations are a special class of linear transformations that "annihilate" vectors after a finite number of applications. Understanding them is important in various areas of linear algebra, especially in the study of canonical forms like the Jordan form, where a transformation is decomposed into diagonal and nilpotent parts.

**Definition:**
*   A linear transformation $f$ is nilpotent if $f^k = o$ (zero transformation) for some integer $k$. This definition comes from the lecture "Jordanův tvar".

The smallest such positive integer $k$ for which $f^k = o$ is called the *index of nilpotency* of $f$. For example, a matrix $N$ is nilpotent if $N^k = 0$ for some $k$. A simple example is a strictly upper (or lower) triangular matrix with zeros on the diagonal.

## Importance

With an overall importance score of 0.8, nilpotent transformations are a highly important concept, particularly as a fundamental building block for more complex theories in linear algebra, such as the Jordan Canonical Form.
