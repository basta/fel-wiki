## Summary
The set of all primitive functions of f on an interval I (if non-empty) is called the indefinite integral of f on I.

## Detailed Explanation
The indefinite integral represents the most general form of the antiderivative for a given function. If $F(x)$ is a primitive function of $f(x)$ on an interval $I$, then any other primitive function of $f(x)$ on $I$ can be expressed as $F(x) + C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.
Thus, the indefinite integral of $f(x)$ is denoted by $\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C$, encompassing all possible primitive functions. This concept is central to solving differential equations and evaluating definite integrals.

## Importance/Relevance
