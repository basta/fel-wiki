# Normalisation

## Summary
The process of scaling vectors in an orthogonal basis such that each vector has a norm of 1, thereby transforming it into an orthonormal basis.

## Detailed Explanation
Normalisation is a fundamental process in linear algebra, particularly when dealing with vector spaces. It involves adjusting the magnitude (or norm) of vectors.

**Definition:**
*   **From lec_90a202ab-80ef-4b06-b3f6-ddefbaa481f3:** Normalisation is defined as "The process of scaling vectors in an orthogonal basis such that each vector has a norm of 1, thereby transforming it into an orthonormal basis."

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, Normalisation is moderately important, especially in contexts requiring standardized vector magnitudes, such as creating orthonormal bases for easier computation and analysis.
