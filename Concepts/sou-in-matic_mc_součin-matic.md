## Summary
For matrices B and A, B.A is a matrix whose j-th column is B times the j-th column of A (B.aj). It is defined if the number of columns of B equals the number of rows of A.

## Detailed Explanation
### Definition
**Matrix Multiplication** (`B.A`) is a fundamental operation that produces a new matrix. The definition states that the `j`-th column of the resulting product matrix `B.A` is obtained by multiplying matrix `B` by the `j`-th column vector of matrix `A` (denoted `B.aj`).

### Conditions for Definition
For the product `B.A` to be defined, a critical condition must be met: the number of columns of the first matrix (`B`) must be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix (`A`). If `B` is an `m x n` matrix and `A` is an `n x p` matrix, then their product `B.A` will be an `m x p` matrix.

## Importance/Relevance
With an `overallImportanceScore` of 1.0, Matrix Multiplication is a highly important and fundamental concept in linear algebra. It is used extensively in various fields, including computer graphics, physics, engineering, and data science, for transformations, solving systems of linear equations, and representing complex relationships.
