# Exponenci√°la matice

## Summary
A matrix function defined via a Taylor series similar to the scalar exponential function, $E^X = \sum(X^n/n!)$. For a diagonalizable matrix $X = T^{-1} D T$, it simplifies to $T^{-1} E^D T$, where $E^D$ is a diagonal matrix with exponentials of the diagonal elements of $D$.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of the matrix exponential extends the familiar scalar exponential function ($e^x$) to matrices. It is defined using its Taylor series expansion:
$$E^X = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{X^n}{n!}$$
where $X$ is a square matrix, $X^0 = I$ (the identity matrix), and $n!$ is the factorial of $n$.

For a diagonalizable matrix $X$, which can be expressed as $X = T^{-1} D T$ (where $D$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $X$, and $T$ is the matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors), the calculation of the matrix exponential simplifies significantly:
$$E^X = T^{-1} E^D T$$
Here, $E^D$ is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal element is the exponential of the corresponding diagonal element in $D$. For example, if $D = \text{diag}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_k)$, then $E^D = \text{diag}(e^{\lambda_1}, e^{\lambda_2}, \dots, e^{\lambda_k})$.

This definition and simplification are crucial for practical applications, especially in solving systems of linear differential equations.
