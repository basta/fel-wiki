# Jordanův segment

## Summary
A block in the Jordan canonical form of a matrix, corresponding to a specific eigenvalue λ_i and having dimensions m_i x m_i, where m_i is the algebraic multiplicity of λ_i. It can be constructed as N_i + λ_i * E_mi, where N_i is the Jordan form of the nilpotent matrix M - λ_i * E_n.

## Detailed Explanation
As defined in lecture "Jordanův tvar" (ID: lec_0b7a9823-c557-4731-a7bd-cf65672dba4d), a Jordanův segment is:
*   A block in the Jordan canonical form of a matrix, corresponding to a specific eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ and having dimensions $m_i \times m_i$, where $m_i$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda_i$. It can be constructed as $N_i + \lambda_i \cdot E_{m_i}$, where $N_i$ is the Jordan form of the nilpotent matrix $M - \lambda_i \cdot E_n$.

## Importance
This concept holds very high importance in its field (Score: 0.9). Jordan segments are crucial for understanding the structure of the Jordan canonical form, as they represent the contribution of each eigenvalue to the overall form of the matrix.
