# na (Surjective/Onto)

## Summary
A function where its range is equal to its codomain (every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one input).

## Detailed Explanation
A function $f: A \to B$ is considered **surjective** (or **onto**) if for every element $y$ in the codomain $B$, there exists at least one element $x$ in the domain $A$ such that $f(x) = y$. In simpler terms, this means that the range of the function is precisely equal to its codomain. Every possible output value in the codomain must be "hit" by at least one input from the domain.

*   **Definition from "Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis"**: A function where its range is equal to its codomain (every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one input).

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of moderate importance (score: 0.7) in mathematics, particularly in areas like abstract algebra and analysis, as it describes a fundamental property of functions related to their mapping capabilities.
