# Gamma Function (Γ(x))

## Summary
The Gamma function is defined as Γ(x) = ∫₀⁺∞ tˣ⁻¹e⁻ᵗ dt, for x > 0.

## Detailed Explanation
The Gamma function is a widely used special function in mathematics, particularly in areas like probability, statistics, and complex analysis. It is an extension of the factorial function to real and complex numbers. For positive integers $n$, the Gamma function satisfies $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!$.

The formal definition for the Gamma function is given by:
$$ \Gamma(x) = \int_0^{+\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt $$
This integral definition is valid for all complex numbers $x$ with a positive real part (Re($x$) > 0).
