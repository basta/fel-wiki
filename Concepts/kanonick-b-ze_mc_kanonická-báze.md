# Kanonická báze

## Summary
For the space R2, the canonical basis K2 is ((1,0), (0,1)). More generally, for Fn over F, the canonical basis Kn = (e1,..., en) consists of standard unit vectors, where ei has 1 at the i-th position and 0 elsewhere. For any vector x = (x1,...,xn)^T in Fn, its coordinates with respect to the canonical basis are simply (x1,...,xn)^T.

## Detailed Explanation
The canonical (or standard) basis is a particularly simple and commonly used basis for coordinate spaces like $R^n$ or $F^n$. Its simplicity and orthogonality (in Euclidean spaces) make it a default choice when no other basis is specified, providing a straightforward way to represent vectors without complex transformations.

### Definition:
For the space $R^2$, the canonical basis $K_2$ is $((1,0), (0,1))$. More generally, for $F^n$ over $F$, the canonical basis $K_n = (e_1,..., e_n)$ consists of standard unit vectors, where $e_i$ has 1 at the i-th position and 0 elsewhere. For any vector $x = (x_1,...,x_n)^T$ in $F^n$, its coordinates with respect to the canonical basis are simply $(x_1,...,x_n)^T$.

## Importance/Relevance
The canonical basis is a very important concept (overall importance score of 0.8) because it provides a straightforward and intuitive way to represent vectors in standard coordinate systems. It serves as a foundational reference for understanding other bases and coordinate transformations, simplifying many linear algebra problems.
