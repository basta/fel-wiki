# Riemann integral

## Summary
The Riemann integral defines the definite integral as the common value found when the supremum of lower integral sums equals the infimum of upper integral sums for a bounded function over a given interval.

## Detailed Explanation
The Riemann integral is a foundational concept in calculus, providing a rigorous definition for the area under a curve. It is constructed by approximating the area using rectangles and then taking the limit as the width of these rectangles approaches zero. This formal definition underpins much of elementary integral calculus.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from Integral Calculus: Formulas, Theorems, and Applications:** The definite integral defined as the common value of the supremum of lower integral sums and the infimum of upper integral sums for an bounded function on an interval.
