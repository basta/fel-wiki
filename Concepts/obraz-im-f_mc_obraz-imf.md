# Obraz (im(f))

## Summary
The image of a linear transformation f: L1 -> L2 is the set of all vectors f(x) for x in L1, i.e., im(f) = {f(x) | x ∈ L1}. It is a subspace of L2.

## Detailed Explanation
*   The image of a linear transformation f: L1 -> L2 is the set of all vectors f(x) for x in L1, i.e., im(f) = {f(x) | x ∈ L1}. It is a subspace of L2. (Source: 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2)

## Importance/Relevance
This concept has an importance score of 85%. The image reveals the span of the transformation's output and is essential for understanding the surjectivity of a linear transformation. Together with the kernel, it forms the basis of the Rank-Nullity Theorem.
