# Monomorfismus

## Summary
A linear transformation $f$ is a monomorphism if it is injective (one-to-one).

## Detailed Explanation
A **monomorphism** is a specific classification for a linear transformation. A linear transformation $f$ is defined as a monomorphism if it possesses the property of being *injective*, which means it is a one-to-one mapping.

### Definitions
*   **Definition 1 (from 05A-2024-Linear-Transformations-Part2):** A linear transformation $f$ is a monomorphism if it is injective (one-to-one).

In simpler terms, for a linear transformation $f: V \to W$, if $f(u) = f(v)$ implies $u = v$ for any vectors $u, v$ in the domain $V$, then $f$ is a monomorphism. This ensures that distinct vectors in the domain are always mapped to distinct vectors in the codomain.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept holds significant importance in the study of linear transformations, as injectivity is a crucial property for understanding the structure-preserving nature of mappings between vector spaces. It is fundamental in classifying linear maps and understanding their kernel.
