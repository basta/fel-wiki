# Homotetie (Homothety)

## Summary
The simplest linear transformation from $L$ to $L$, where $f(x) = \lambda \cdot x$.

## Detailed Explanation
**Homothety** (or **homothetie** in Czech) represents a very straightforward type of linear transformation. It describes a transformation from a vector space $L$ to itself where every vector $x$ is simply scaled by a fixed scalar factor $\lambda$. The transformation can be written as:
$$f(x) = \lambda \cdot x$$
Here, $\lambda$ is a scalar (from the field $F$, typically real or complex numbers) that determines the scaling.

*   If $|\lambda| > 1$, the transformation expands vectors.
*   If $|\lambda| < 1$, it contracts vectors.
*   If $\lambda = 1$, it's the identity transformation.
*   If $\lambda = -1$, it's a point reflection through the origin.
*   If $\lambda = 0$, it maps all vectors to the zero vector.

Geometrically, a homothety expands or shrinks objects uniformly around a fixed point (the center of homothety, which is the origin for linear transformations). All points move along lines passing through the origin.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.6, homothety is a moderately important concept. While simple, it serves as a foundational example for understanding linear transformations, especially in the context of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, where eigenvectors essentially define directions along which a more complex transformation behaves as a homothety. It is relevant in geometry, computer graphics (scaling operations), and for building intuition about more complex linear mappings.
