# Extended Real Numbers

## Summary
The set of real numbers R augmented with positive and negative infinity, denoted as $\bar{R} = R \cup \{-\infty, +\infty\}$.

## Detailed Explanation
The set of extended real numbers expands the familiar set of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) by including two additional elements: positive infinity ($+\infty$) and negative infinity ($-\infty$). This augmentation is particularly useful in calculus and analysis for discussing limits, integrals, and the supremum/infimum of unbounded sets.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** "The set of real numbers R augmented with positive and negative infinity, denoted as R bar = R U {-∞, +∞}."

The notation for the set of extended real numbers is typically $\bar{\mathbb{R}}$ or $[-\infty, +\infty]$.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is moderately important (Importance Score: 0.7) for understanding concepts related to limits, sequences, and series, especially when dealing with unbounded behavior or values that approach infinity.

## Connections
