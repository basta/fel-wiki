# Periodic Function

## Summary
A periodic function ƒ is one for which ƒ(x+p) = ƒ(x) for some constant p > 0, known as its period, and for all x in its domain. The smallest positive value of p is called the fundamental period.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of a periodic function is defined as:
*   A function ƒ where ƒ(x+p) = ƒ(x) for some constant p > 0 (period) and all x in its domain. The smallest such p is the fundamental period. (Source: calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01)

This property means that the function's values repeat over regular intervals. Common examples include trigonometric functions like sine and cosine.

## Importance/Relevance
This is an important concept in mathematics, especially in the study of oscillations, waves, and signal processing, where phenomena exhibit repeating patterns.
