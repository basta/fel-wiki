# Maticový zápis

## Summary
The representation of linear transformations using matrices, especially with respect to canonical bases.

## Detailed Explanation
Maticový zápis, or matrix notation, refers to the method of representing linear transformations as matrices. This representation is particularly useful when dealing with linear transformations, as it allows complex operations to be simplified into matrix algebra. When using matrix notation, it is common to define the transformation with respect to specific bases, with canonical bases being a frequently used choice due to their simplicity and ease of use.
