# Iterative Gauss-Seidel Method

## Summary
An iterative numerical method for solving a system of linear equations, often preferred over direct methods like GEM for large systems due to better numerical stability.

## Detailed Explanation
The Iterative Gauss-Seidel Method is a widely used technique for finding approximate solutions to systems of linear equations. Unlike direct methods (such as Gaussian Elimination Method - GEM) which aim to find the exact solution in a finite number of steps, iterative methods refine an initial guess through successive approximations until a desired level of accuracy is reached.

*   It's particularly beneficial for very large systems of equations, where direct methods can become computationally expensive or suffer from numerical instability due to accumulated rounding errors.
*   The method works by iteratively updating the components of the solution vector using the most recently computed values of the other components in the current iteration.
