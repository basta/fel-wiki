# Uspořádaná báze (Ordered Basis)

## Summary
If a basis $B$ is finite, then the list of its elements is called an ordered basis.

## Detailed Explanation
A **basis** of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space. While a standard basis is typically considered a set (where the order of elements does not matter), an **ordered basis** introduces the concept of sequence or arrangement for the basis vectors.

When a basis $B$ is finite, meaning it contains a countable number of vectors (e.g., $B = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$), we can list its elements in a specific order. This ordered list is what constitutes an ordered basis. For example, $(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)$ is an ordered basis, which is distinct from $(v_2, v_1, \dots, v_n)$ even if they contain the same vectors.

The ordering of basis vectors is crucial in several contexts, most notably when dealing with:

*   **Coordinate Vectors:** The coordinates of a vector with respect to an ordered basis depend on the order of the basis vectors. A change in order would result in a different coordinate representation for the same vector.
*   **Matrix Representations of Linear Transformations:** The matrix representation of a linear transformation is defined with respect to specific ordered bases for the domain and codomain.

## Key Aspects/Components
N/A - Specific components are not explicitly detailed in the provided data.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is important (Overall Importance Score: 0.7) because it provides the framework for defining **coordinate systems** in vector spaces. The ability to uniquely represent any vector as a column vector of coordinates relies directly on having an ordered basis. This is fundamental for computations in linear algebra.
