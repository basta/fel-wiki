# Limes inferior

## Summary
The limit inferior of a sequence, denoted $\lim \inf a_n$, is the smallest accumulation point of the sequence.

## Detailed Explanation
The Limes inferior, or limit inferior, gives insight into the lower bounds of the values that a sequence approaches. It is the smallest value that the sequence "hits" infinitely often.

**Definition:**
*   The limit inferior of a sequence, denoted $\lim \inf a_n$, is the smallest accumulation point of the sequence.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.6, this concept is important in real analysis for understanding the long-term behavior of sequences, particularly those that do not converge but oscillate. It complements the Limes superior by identifying the lowest accumulation point.
