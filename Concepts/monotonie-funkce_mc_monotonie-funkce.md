# Monotonie funkce

## Summary
A function f is monotonic on an interval I if it is either increasing, decreasing, non-decreasing, or non-increasing over that interval. Specifically, if f'(x) > 0 on I, then f is increasing on I.

## Detailed Explanation
* A function $f$ is monotonic on an interval $I$ if it is either increasing, decreasing, non-decreasing, or non-increasing over that interval. Specifically, if $f'(x) > 0$ on $I$, then $f$ is increasing on $I$. (Source: Calculus: Derivatives, Functions, Sequences, and Integrals)
