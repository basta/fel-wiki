# iracionální čísla (Irrational Numbers)

## Summary
The set of irrational numbers, denoted by R\Q (real numbers minus rational numbers). An example is √2.

## Detailed Explanation
Irrational numbers are real numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction $p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q$ is not zero. Their decimal expansions are infinite and non-repeating. They fill the "gaps" between rational numbers on the number line.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from "Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis"**: The set of irrational numbers, denoted by R\Q (real numbers minus rational numbers). An example is √2.

## Importance/Relevance
Irrational numbers are important (score: 0.7) for understanding the completeness of the real number line and for various geometric and analytical concepts. Famous examples include $\pi$ (Pi) and $e$ (Euler's number).
