# Limes superior

## Summary
The limit superior of a sequence, denoted $\lim \sup a_n$, is the largest accumulation point of the sequence.

## Detailed Explanation
The Limes superior, or limit superior, provides information about the upper bounds of the values that a sequence approaches. It is the largest value that the sequence "hits" infinitely often.

**Definition:**
*   The limit superior of a sequence, denoted $\lim \sup a_n$, is the largest accumulation point of the sequence.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.6, this concept is important in real analysis for understanding the long-term behavior of sequences, especially for sequences that do not converge but oscillate. It is closely related to the concept of accumulation points.
