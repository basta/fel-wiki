# Jordanova buňka

## Summary
A square matrix of the form with λ on the diagonal, ones on the superdiagonal, and zeros elsewhere. For a nilpotent Jordan block (λ=0), its index of nilpotency equals its dimension.

## Detailed Explanation
As defined in lecture "Jordanův tvar" (ID: lec_0b7a9823-c557-4731-a7bd-cf65672dba4d), a Jordanova buňka is:
*   A square matrix of the form with $\lambda$ on the diagonal, ones on the superdiagonal, and zeros elsewhere. For a nilpotent Jordan block ($\lambda=0$), its index of nilpotency equals its dimension.

## Importance
This concept holds very high importance in its field (Score: 0.9). Jordan blocks are the fundamental building blocks of the Jordan canonical form, which is a key concept in linear algebra for understanding the structure of linear operators and matrices.
