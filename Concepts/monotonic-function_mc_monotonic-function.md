# Monotonic Function

## Summary
A function that is either strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, non-decreasing, or non-increasing. Monotonic functions are injective and have monotonic inverse functions.

## Detailed Explanation
A monotonic function is a function that preserves a given order. This means that as the input values increase, the output values either consistently increase (or stay the same) or consistently decrease (or stay the same). There are four specific types of monotonic functions:

*   **Strictly Increasing:** For any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$.
*   **Strictly Decreasing:** For any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.
*   **Non-decreasing (Monotonically Increasing):** For any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) \le f(x_2)$.
*   **Non-increasing (Monotonically Decreasing):** For any $x_1 < x_2$, $f(x_1) \ge f(x_2)$.

A key property of monotonic functions (especially strictly monotonic ones) is that they are injective. This is because if a function is always increasing or always decreasing, distinct inputs will always produce distinct outputs. As a result, monotonic functions often have well-behaved inverse functions which are also monotonic.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** A function that is either strictly increasing, strictly decreasing, non-decreasing, or non-increasing. Monotonic functions are injective and have monotonic inverse functions.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of high importance (score: 0.8) in calculus and analysis. Monotonicity is crucial for proving existence of limits, convergence of sequences and series, and for properties of inverse functions. It simplifies analysis by guaranteeing predictable behavior of a function.
