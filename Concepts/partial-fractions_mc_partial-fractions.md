# Partial fractions

## Summary
Partial fractions are simpler rational expressions that, when summed together, reconstitute a given complex rational function. They are primarily used as a technique to simplify complex rational functions for integration, and typically take forms such as $A/(x-a)^n$ or $(Ax+B)/(x^2+px+q)^n$.

## Detailed Explanation
Partial fractions represent a powerful algebraic technique employed in calculus to decompose a rational function into a sum of simpler fractions. This decomposition simplifies the integration process, as these simpler forms are generally easier to integrate individually.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from Integral Calculus: Formulas, Theorems, and Applications:** Simpler rational expressions that sum up to a given complex rational function, used for integration. Forms include $A/(x-a)^n$ and $(Ax+B)/(x^2+px+q)^n$.
