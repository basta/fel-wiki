# Chain Rule

## Summary
If ƒ has a derivative at 'a' and g has a derivative at ƒ(a)=b, then the derivative of the composite function (g ∘ ƒ) at 'a' is g'(b) · ƒ'(a).

## Detailed Explanation
The Chain Rule is a crucial differentiation rule used to find the derivative of a composite function. A composite function is a function within a function, such as $h(x) = g(f(x))$. The Chain Rule allows us to break down the differentiation of such complex functions into simpler, manageable steps. It essentially states that the derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the "outer" function evaluated at the "inner" function, multiplied by the derivative of the "inner" function.

**Definition:**
*   From `calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01`: "If ƒ has a derivative at 'a' and g has a derivative at ƒ(a)=b, then the derivative of the composite function (g ∘ ƒ) at 'a' is $g'(b) \cdot ƒ'(a)$."
