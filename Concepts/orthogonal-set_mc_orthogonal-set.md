# Orthogonal Set

## Summary
A set of non-zero vectors where any two distinct vectors are orthogonal.

## Detailed Explanation
An Orthogonal Set is a collection of vectors with a specific property: every distinct pair of vectors within the set is orthogonal to each other. This means that if you take any two different vectors from the set, their scalar product will be zero.

It's important that the vectors in the set are non-zero. While the zero vector is orthogonal to every vector, including itself, an orthogonal set typically refers to a set of non-zero vectors that are mutually perpendicular.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.7, orthogonal sets are significant because they often form the basis for constructing more structured sets like orthogonal bases, which simplify many mathematical operations and analyses. They are fundamental in fields like signal processing, data compression, and numerical analysis.
