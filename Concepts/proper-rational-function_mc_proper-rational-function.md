# Proper rational function

## Summary
A proper rational function is a specific type of rational function where the degree of the numerator polynomial (P) is strictly less than the degree of the denominator polynomial (Q).

## Detailed Explanation
While a rational function is any ratio of polynomials, a proper rational function imposes an additional condition on the degrees of the polynomials involved. This distinction is particularly important in techniques like partial fraction decomposition, where only proper rational functions can be directly decomposed without an initial step of polynomial long division.

### Definitions
*   **Definition from Integral Calculus: Formulas, Theorems, and Applications:** A rational function where the degree of the numerator polynomial P is strictly less than the degree of the denominator polynomial Q.

## Key Aspects/Components
