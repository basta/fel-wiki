# Convergence of Improper Integrals

## Summary
Improper integrals are said to converge if their value is a finite number. A key criterion for this convergence is comparison: If the absolute value of a piecewise continuous function $f$ is less than or equal to another function $g$ on an interval $(a,b)$, and the improper integral of $g$ converges, then the improper integral of $f$ also converges.

## Detailed Explanation
The concept of convergence for improper integrals is crucial for determining whether an integral over an infinite interval or an interval containing a discontinuity has a finite value. This is often established using comparison tests.

### Definitions:
*   **Definition 1 (Comparison Test for Convergence):** If $|f| \leq g$ on an interval $(a,b)$ and the improper integral $\int g$ converges, and $f$ is piecewise continuous, then the improper integral $\int f$ also converges.

*   **Definition 2 (Comparison Test for Divergence):** If $f \leq g$ on an interval $(a,b)$ and the improper integral $\int f$ diverges to $+\infty$, and $g$ is piecewise continuous, then the improper integral $\int g$ also diverges to $+\infty$.

These definitions highlight a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of improper integrals without necessarily evaluating them directly. They allow us to infer convergence or divergence by comparing a given function to a known convergent or divergent function.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (overall importance score: 0.8) in integral calculus as it provides fundamental tools, known as comparison tests, to determine the convergence or divergence of improper integrals. These tests are essential when direct evaluation of an integral is difficult or impossible.
