# Real Function

## Summary
A mapping $f$ from a non-empty subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ (domain $D(f)$) to $\mathbb{R}$ (range $R(f)$), where the graph is a visualization in the plane.

## Detailed Explanation
A real function is a core concept in mathematics, particularly in calculus and analysis. It describes a relationship where each input from a specific set of real numbers corresponds to exactly one output, which is also a real number.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** "A mapping Æ’ from a non-empty subset A of R (domain D(f)) to R (range R(f)), where the graph is a visualization in the plane."

Let's break down the components:
*   **Mapping ($f$):** This denotes the rule or process that transforms an input into an output.
*   **Domain ($D(f)$):** This is the non-empty subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}$ from which the inputs to the function are drawn. For each element in the domain, the function must be defined.
*   **Codomain/Range ($R(f)$):** The outputs of the function are real numbers, belonging to the set $\mathbb{R}$. The *range* specifically refers to the set of all actual output values produced by the function.
*   **Graph:** The graph of a real function $f$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(x, f(x))$ where $x$ is in the domain of $f$. When plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system, this forms a visual representation of the function in the plane.

In simpler terms, a real function takes a real number as an input, applies a rule to it, and produces another real number as an output.

## Importance/Relevance
This is a highly important concept (Importance Score: 0.8) as real functions are the primary objects of study in calculus. Understanding them is essential for topics like limits, derivatives, integrals, and differential equations, which are fundamental to modeling real-world phenomena.
