# Prosté zobrazení / Injekce

## Summary
A mapping f : X -> Y is injective (or one-to-one) if for any x1, x2 in X, f(x1) = f(x2) implies x1 = x2.

## Detailed Explanation
An **injective mapping** (also known as a **one-to-one function** or **prosté zobrazení**) is a type of function where every distinct element in the domain maps to a distinct element in the codomain. In simpler terms, no two different inputs can produce the same output.

### Definition
According to the provided definition from lecture "Souřadnice vzhledem k uspořádané bázi a komutativní diagramy":
"A mapping $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is injective (or one-to-one) if for any $x_1, x_2$ in $X$, $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ implies $x_1 = x_2$."

This definition means that if you have two elements in the domain $X$ that produce the same output in $Y$ under the function $f$, then those two elements must actually be the same element. This is equivalent to saying that if $x_1 \neq x_2$, then $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (Importance Score: 0.8) in various mathematical disciplines. Injective functions are crucial for defining inverse functions, understanding isomorphisms, and analyzing the uniqueness of solutions in equations.
