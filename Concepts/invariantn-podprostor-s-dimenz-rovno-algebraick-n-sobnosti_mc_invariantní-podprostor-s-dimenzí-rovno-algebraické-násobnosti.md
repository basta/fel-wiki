# Invariantní podprostor s dimenzí rovno algebraické násobnosti

## Summary
For a diagonalizable matrix, invariant subspaces V_i can be chosen such that their dimension equals the algebraic multiplicity (m_i) of the corresponding eigenvalue. If dim(V_i) < m_i, the matrix is not diagonalizable.

## Detailed Explanation
This concept provides a crucial criterion for determining if a matrix is diagonalizable. For a matrix to be diagonalizable, for each eigenvalue, the dimension of its corresponding invariant subspace must be equal to the algebraic multiplicity of that eigenvalue. The invariant subspace in this context often refers to the generalized eigenspace.

If, for any eigenvalue, the dimension of its eigenspace (geometric multiplicity) is less than its algebraic multiplicity, the matrix cannot be diagonalized in the usual sense. This condition is directly related to the existence of a basis of eigenvectors that spans the entire vector space.

**Definition:**
*   For a diagonalizable matrix, invariant subspaces V_i can be chosen such that their dimension equals the algebraic multiplicity (m_i) of the corresponding eigenvalue. If dim(V_i) < m_i, the matrix is not diagonalizable. (Source: Lecture "Jordanův tvar")
