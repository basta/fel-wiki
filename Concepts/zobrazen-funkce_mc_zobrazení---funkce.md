## Summary
A mapping (or function) f : X -> Y means that for every element x in the domain X, there is exactly one corresponding element y in the codomain Y, denoted as f(x).

## Detailed Explanation
A fundamental concept in mathematics, a **mapping** (often interchangeably called a **function**) describes a special type of relation between two sets.

### Definition
According to the provided definition from lecture "Souřadnice vzhledem k uspořádané bázi a komutativní diagramy":
"A mapping (or function) $f : X \rightarrow Y$ means that for every element $x$ in the domain $X$, there is exactly one corresponding element $y$ in the codomain $Y$, denoted as $f(x)$."

This means that for any input from the set $X$ (the domain), there is precisely one output in the set $Y$ (the codomain). No input can have multiple outputs, and every input must have an output.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (Importance Score: 0.8) as it forms the bedrock for many areas of mathematics, including algebra, calculus, and discrete mathematics. Functions are used to model relationships between quantities and are essential for understanding transformations and operations.
