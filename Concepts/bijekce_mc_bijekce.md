## Summary
A mapping $f : X \rightarrow Y$ is a bijection (or one-to-one correspondence) if it is both injective and surjective simultaneously.

## Detailed Explanation
A **bijection**, also known as a **one-to-one correspondence**, is a fundamental type of mapping in mathematics. It combines the properties of two other important types of mappings:

*   **Injective (One-to-one):** Every distinct element in the domain maps to a distinct element in the codomain. This means no two elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain.
*   **Surjective (Onto):** Every element in the codomain has at least one corresponding element in the domain. The image of the mapping is equal to its codomain.

Therefore, for a mapping $f : X \rightarrow Y$ to be a bijection, it must satisfy both conditions: each element in $Y$ must be mapped to by exactly one element in $X$. This establishes a perfect pairing between the elements of the domain and the codomain.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is highly important (Overall Importance Score: 0.9) as bijections are essential for understanding invertibility, isomorphisms, and for defining cardinality in set theory. They signify a complete and reversible relationship between two sets.
