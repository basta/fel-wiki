# Gaussova metoda (Gaussian method)

## Summary
Gaussian method is a numerical integration method characterized by optimal choice of nodes and weights, where its order is twice the number of nodes.

## Detailed Explanation
The Gaussian method, often referring to Gaussian quadrature in the context of numerical integration, is a powerful technique for approximating definite integrals. It distinguishes itself from methods like Newton-Cotes by not requiring the integration points (nodes) to be equally spaced. Instead, it strategically chooses both the nodes and associated weights to achieve the highest possible precision for a given number of nodes.
