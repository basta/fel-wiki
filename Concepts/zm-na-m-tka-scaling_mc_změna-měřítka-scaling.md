# Změna měřítka (Scaling)

## Summary
A linear transformation in R^2 that scales the components of a vector by factors a and b. It's represented by a diagonal matrix [[a, 0], [0, b]].

## Detailed Explanation
According to definition from lecture "Lineární zobrazení" (ID: lec_3a1d5599-e40d-4042-832d-d69b45499fe2):
A linear transformation in $R^2$ that scales the components of a vector by factors $a$ and $b$. It's represented by a diagonal matrix $\begin{bmatrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{bmatrix}$.
