## Summary
Sets that have the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ are called countable.

## Detailed Explanation
Countable sets are those whose elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with a subset of the natural numbers. This means we can, in principle, list all the elements of a countable set, even if it's infinite.

**Definition:**
*   Sets that have the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ are called countable.

## Importance/Relevance
With an overall importance score of 0.6, the concept of countable sets is fundamental in set theory and analysis. It distinguishes between different "sizes" of infinite sets, such as the countable integers and rational numbers versus the uncountable real numbers. This distinction has profound implications in areas like computability and measure theory.
