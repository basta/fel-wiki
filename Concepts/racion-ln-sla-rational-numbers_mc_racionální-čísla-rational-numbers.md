# racionální čísla (Rational Numbers)

## Summary
The set of rational numbers, denoted by Q. These are numbers that have a finite or periodic decimal expansion.

## Detailed Explanation
Rational numbers are a fundamental concept in mathematics. They are defined as numbers that can be expressed as a fraction $p/q$, where $p$ is an integer and $q$ is a non-zero integer.

### Definitions
