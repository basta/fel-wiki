# Injective Function (prost√°)

## Summary
A function where distinct inputs map to distinct outputs.

## Detailed Explanation
An injective function, also known as a one-to-one function, ensures that every unique input from its domain maps to a unique output in its codomain. This means that if $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then it must be true that $x_1 = x_2$. Conversely, if $x_1 \neq x_2$, then $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** A function where distinct inputs map to distinct outputs.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of moderate importance (score: 0.7) in mathematics, particularly in calculus and abstract algebra, as it is a fundamental property defining how functions behave and is crucial for understanding concepts like inverse functions.
