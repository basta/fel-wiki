# Rational function

## Summary
A rational function is defined as a ratio of two polynomials, P/Q, where the denominator polynomial Q is not the zero polynomial.

## Detailed Explanation
A rational function is fundamentally characterized by its algebraic structure, being formed by the division of one polynomial by another. This mathematical form is crucial in various areas of calculus and algebra.
