# Přerovnání řady (Rearrangement of series)

## Summary
For a series $$ \sum a_k $$, a rearrangement is a new series $$ \sum a_{f(k)} $$ where $f$ is a bijection on the natural numbers $N$.

## Detailed Explanation
A rearrangement of a series refers to reordering the terms of the series. While for finite sums the order of addition does not affect the sum, for infinite series, the order of terms can dramatically change the sum, or even change a convergent series into a divergent one. This phenomenon is particularly significant for conditionally convergent series.

According to lecture lec-math-2023-001, a rearrangement of a series is defined as:
*   "For a series $$ \sum a_k $$, a rearrangement is a new series $$ \sum a_{f(k)} $$ where $f$ is a bijection on the natural numbers $N$."

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is relevant for understanding the behavior of infinite series, especially distinguishing between absolute and conditional convergence, as only absolutely convergent series can be freely rearranged without altering their sum.
