## Detailed Explanation
A local extremum is a general term used to describe points where a function reaches either a local maximum or a local minimum. It encompasses both types of "turning points" within a function's graph, where the function's behavior changes from increasing to decreasing (local maximum) or decreasing to increasing (local minimum).
