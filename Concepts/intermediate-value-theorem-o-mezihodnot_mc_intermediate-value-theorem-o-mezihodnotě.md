# Intermediate Value Theorem (o mezihodnotě)

## Summary
If a function ƒ is continuous on an interval and takes values m and M, then it takes on every value between m and M within that interval.

## Detailed Explanation
The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) is a fundamental concept in calculus concerning continuous functions. It essentially states that for a continuous function on a closed interval, if the function takes on two values, it must also take on every value between those two.

**Definition:**
*   From `calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01`: "If a function ƒ is continuous on an interval and takes values m and M, then it takes on every value between m and M within that interval."

## Importance/Relevance
