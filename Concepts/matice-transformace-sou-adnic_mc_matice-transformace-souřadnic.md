## Summary
Matrices T and S used to convert a linear transformation's matrix representation from one basis to another, often relating to identity transformations between coordinate spaces.

## Detailed Explanation
This concept refers to the matrices, typically denoted as T and S, that are instrumental in changing the matrix representation of a linear transformation from one basis to another. They are frequently associated with identity transformations that bridge different coordinate spaces.
