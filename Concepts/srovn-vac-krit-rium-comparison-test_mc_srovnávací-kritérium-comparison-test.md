# Srovnávací kritérium (Comparison test)

## Summary
The Comparison Test for series $\sum a_k$ and $\sum b_k$ with $0 \leq a_k \leq b_k$ states that if $\sum b_k$ converges, then $\sum a_k$ converges. Conversely, if $\sum a_k$ diverges, then $\sum b_k$ diverges.

## Detailed Explanation
The core principle of the Comparison Test relies on comparing the terms of two series.
*   **Definition:** For series $\sum a_k$ and $\sum b_k$ with $0 \leq a_k \leq b_k$:
    *   If the "larger" series $\sum b_k$ converges, then the "smaller" series $\sum a_k$ must also converge.
    *   If the "smaller" series $\sum a_k$ diverges, then the "larger" series $\sum b_k$ must also diverge.

This test is particularly useful for series with non-negative terms. It allows us to determine the convergence or divergence of an unknown series by comparing it to a known convergent or divergent series.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of **high importance** (score: 0.7) in the study of series convergence as it offers a direct method for determining convergence by comparison, especially when terms are positive. It is a fundamental tool for evaluating the behavior of many series.
