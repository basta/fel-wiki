# Inverse Function

## Summary
For a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, its inverse $f^{-1}: R(f) \rightarrow A$ is such that $(f^{-1} \circ f)(x) = x$. An inverse exists if and only if the function is injective.

## Detailed Explanation
An inverse function "reverses" the action of the original function. If a function $f$ maps an element $x$ from set $A$ to an element $y$ in set $B$ (i.e., $f(x) = y$), then its inverse function, denoted $f^{-1}$, maps $y$ back to $x$ (i.e., $f^{-1}(y) = x$). The domain of the inverse function is the range of the original function.

A crucial condition for an inverse function to exist is that the original function must be injective (one-to-one). If a function is not injective, multiple inputs could map to the same output, making it impossible to uniquely reverse the mapping. While the provided definition only explicitly states injectivity, typically, for a full inverse mapping $B \rightarrow A$ to exist, the function should also be surjective onto its codomain $B$ (i.e., bijective). However, the definition provided focuses on injectivity as the core condition for $f^{-1}$ to be a well-defined function *on its range*.

**Definition:**
*   **From calculus-intro-basic-concepts-lect01:** For a function $f: A \rightarrow B$, its inverse $f^{-1}: R(f) \rightarrow A$ is such that $(f^{-1} \circ f)(x) = x$. An inverse exists if and only if the function is injective.

## Importance/Relevance
This concept is of high importance (score: 0.8) in mathematics, particularly in calculus, where it is used to define functions like logarithms, inverse trigonometric functions, and in solving equations. Inverse functions are fundamental for understanding reversible processes and transformations.
