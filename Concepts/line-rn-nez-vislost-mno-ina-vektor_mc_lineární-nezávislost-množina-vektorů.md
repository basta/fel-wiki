# Lineární nezávislost (množina vektorů)

## Summary
A set M of vectors in a linear space L is linearly independent if it is an empty set, or if it is a non-empty finite set ${x_1,...,x_n}$ where $a_1 \cdot x_1 + ... + a_n \cdot x_n = 0$ implies $a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = 0$. For an infinite set, it is linearly independent if every finite subset of it is linearly independent.

## Detailed Explanation
- A set M of vectors in a linear space L is linearly independent if it is an empty set, or if it is a non-empty finite set ${x_1,...,x_n}$ where $a_1 \cdot x_1 + ... + a_n \cdot x_n = 0$ implies $a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = 0$. For an infinite set, it is linearly independent if every finite subset of it is linearly independent.
