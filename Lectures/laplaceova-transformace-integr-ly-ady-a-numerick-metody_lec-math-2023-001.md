# Laplaceova transformace, Integrály, Řady a Numerické Metody

This lecture provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts in mathematical analysis, starting with essential transforms and applications of integral calculus, moving through the theory of infinite series, and concluding with practical numerical integration methods and asymptotic notation. The aim is to equip students with a solid understanding of these core mathematical tools.

## Fundamental Concepts in Analysis

The lecture began by introducing the **Laplace Transform**, a powerful tool used to convert functions of a real variable (often time, $t$) into functions of a complex variable (frequency, $p$). Formally, the [Laplace Transform](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/laplaceova-transformace-laplace-transform) of a piecewise continuous function $f(t)$ defined on $(0, +\infty)$ is given by the integral:
$$F(p) = \int_0^{+\infty} f(t)e^{-pt} dt$$
This definition is valid for $p > a$ (or $\text{Re}(p) > a$ in the complex plane), where $a$ is a constant related to the exponential growth of $f(t)$. Closely related is the **Gamma Function**, $\Gamma(x)$, which is defined for $x > 0$ as:
$$\Gamma(x) = \int_0^{+\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt$$
These transforms are crucial in various fields, including solving differential equations and probability theory.

## Applications of Integral Calculus

Following the introduction to transforms, the lecture delved into practical applications of definite integrals. A key concept discussed was the **mean value of a function** over an interval $(a, b)$, defined as:
$$\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x)dx$$
A fundamental theorem states that a continuous function on a closed interval will always attain its [mean value of f](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/st-edn-hodnota-f-mean-value-of-f).

Further applications of integrals included:
*   **Area between curves**: For two piecewise continuous functions $f$ and $g$ such that $f(x) \le g(x)$ on $(a, b)$, the area between their graphs is calculated by:
    $$\int_a^b (g(x)-f(x)) dx$$
*   **Arc length**: The length of the graph of a function $f$ with a piecewise continuous derivative on $(a, b)$ is given by:
    $$\int_a^b \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2} dx$$
*   **Volumes and Surface Areas of Revolution**:
    *   The volume of a solid generated by rotating the region under $f(x)$ around the x-axis is:
        $$\pi \int_a^b f^2(x) dx$$
    *   The surface area created by rotating the graph of $f$ around the x-axis is:
        $$2\pi \int_a^b f(x) \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2} dx$$

These formulas provide powerful methods for calculating geometrical properties in two and three dimensions using integration.

## Infinite Series and Their Convergence

A significant portion of the lecture was dedicated to **infinite numerical series**. An [Infinite numerical series](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/nekone-n-seln-ada-infinite-numerical-series) is expressed as $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k = a_1+a_2+a_3+\dots$, where $a_k$ is the k-th term. The sum of the first $n$ terms, $s_n = a_1 + \dots + a_n$, is known as the [n-th partial sum](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/n-t-ste-n-sou-et-n-th-partial-sum). The lecture clarified the three possible behaviors of a series based on the limit of its partial sums:
*   [Series Convergence](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/konvergence-ady-series-convergence): The series converges if its partial sums approach a finite limit.
*   [Series Divergence](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/divergence-ady-series-divergence): The series diverges if its partial sums approach an infinite limit.
*   [Series Oscillation](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/oscilace-ady-series-oscillation): The series oscillates if its partial sums have no limit.

Key types of series and their properties were discussed, including the [Geometric series](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/geometrick-ada-geometric-series), $\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_1 q^{k-1}$, which converges to $\frac{a_1}{1-q}$ for $|q| < 1$ and diverges otherwise (for $a_1 \neq 0$). Properties of series sums, such as linearity ($\sum(a_k+b_k) = \sum a_k + \sum b_k$ and $\sum c a_k = c \sum a_k$), were also covered. A crucial necessary condition for convergence is that if a series $\sum a_k$ converges, then $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0$. Additionally, series with non-negative terms always have a sum greater than or equal to zero.

Several convergence tests were presented to determine the behavior of a series:
*   [Comparison Test](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/srovn-vac-krit-rium-comparison-test): If $0 \le a_k \le b_k$ for all $k$, then convergence of $\sum b_k$ implies convergence of $\sum a_k$, and divergence of $\sum a_k$ implies divergence of $\sum b_k$.
*   [Absolute convergence](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/absolutn-konvergentn-ada-absolutely-convergent-series): A series $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely if $\sum|a_k|$ converges. An important theorem states that absolutely convergent series always converge.
*   [Ratio Test](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/pod-lov-krit-rium-ratio-test): For $a_k \neq 0$, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} |\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}| < 1$, the series converges absolutely. If the limit is greater than 1, it diverges.
*   [Root Test](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/odmocninov-krit-rium-root-test): Similar to the ratio test, but uses $\lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{|a_k|}$.
*   [Integral Test](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/integr-ln-krit-rium-integral-test): If $f$ is a non-increasing function such that $f(k) = |a_k|$ for $k \ge k_0$, then $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely if and only if $\int_{k_0}^\infty f(x)dx$ converges.
*   [Leibniz criterion](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/leibnizovo-krit-rium-alternating-series-test): For alternating series $\sum (-1)^{k-1} b_k$, if $(b_k)$ is a non-increasing sequence with a zero limit, the series converges.

Finally, the concept of a [Rearrangement of series](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/p-erovn-n-ady-rearrangement-of-series) was introduced. For an absolutely convergent series, any rearrangement also converges absolutely to the same sum. This property allows for manipulation of terms in such series without changing their sum.

## Numerical Integration Methods

The lecture then transitioned to practical numerical methods for approximating definite integrals. Various techniques were presented, each with its own advantages:
*   The [Gaussian method](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/gaussova-metoda-gaussian-quadrature) (or Gaussian quadrature) is noted for its optimal choice of nodes and weights, achieving an order of accuracy twice the number of nodes used.
*   The [Newton-Cotes methods](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/newtonovy-cotesovy-metody-newton-cotes-methods) are a family of formulas based on equidistant divisions of the integration interval. They can be "closed" (including endpoints) or "open" (excluding endpoints). Specific methods include:
    *   The [Rectangle method](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/obd-ln-kov-metoda-midpoint-rule) (often the midpoint rule), which approximates the area by rectangles using the function value at the midpoint of each subinterval.
    *   The [Trapezoidal method](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/lichob-n-kov-metoda-trapezoidal-method), which approximates the integral by linearly interpolating the function over each subinterval, forming trapezoids.
    *   [Simpson's method](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/simpsonova-metoda-simpsons-method), a more accurate method that approximates the function with parabolic segments.

To further enhance the accuracy of numerical approximations, [Richardson Extrapolation](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/richardsonova-extrapolace-richardson-extrapolation) was introduced. This technique leverages approximations at different step sizes ($h$) to extrapolate to a more accurate result, following the form:
$$F(h)= F(0)+ah^p+O(h^q), \text{ where } q>p$$
An example of calculating a definite integral with a specified precision highlighted the practical application and comparative effectiveness of various numerical methods (Rectangle, Trapezoidal, Simpson's, Romberg, Gauss).

## Asymptotic Notation and Dedekind Cuts

The lecture concluded with an introduction to **asymptotic notation**, essential for describing the limiting behavior and growth rates of functions.
*   [Big O notation (O(g))](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/big-o-notation-o-g) signifies an upper bound: $f \in O(g)$ as $x \to a$ if there exists a constant $M$ such that $|f(x)| \le M |g(x)|$ in a punctured neighborhood of $a$.
*   [Big Theta notation (Θ(g))](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/big-theta-notation-g) denotes a tight bound: $f \in \Theta(g)$ as $x \to a$ if there exist positive constants $m, M$ such that $m|g(x)| \le |f(x)| \le M |g(x)|$ in a punctured neighborhood of $a$.
These notations are closed under addition and multiplication, making them practical for analyzing algorithmic complexity and function behavior.

Finally, a brief mention of **Dedekind Cuts** provided a glimpse into the foundational construction of real numbers. A [Dedekind Cut](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/ez-dedekind-cut) is defined as a partition of the set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ into two non-empty sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A \cup B = \mathbb{Q}$ and every element in $A$ is less than every element in $B$. This concept is fundamental to understanding the completeness of the real number system.

This lecture covered a broad spectrum of advanced mathematical concepts, from theoretical definitions to practical applications in numerical analysis, providing a robust foundation for further study in mathematics and engineering.
