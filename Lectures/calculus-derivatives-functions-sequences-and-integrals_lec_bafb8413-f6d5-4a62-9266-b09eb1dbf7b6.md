# Calculus: Derivatives, Functions, Sequences, and Integrals

## Introduction to Calculus Fundamentals

This lecture provided a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts in calculus, encompassing derivatives, Taylor series, and key properties of functions like monotonicity, local extrema, convexity, and asymptotes. It further delved into the realm of sequences, their convergence, accumulation points, and related concepts such as limit superior and limit inferior. The lecture also touched upon basic set theory, including cardinality and countable sets, before concluding with an introduction to primitive functions and indefinite integrals.

## Differential Calculus: Understanding Function Behavior

The lecture began by formalizing the concept of derivatives, defining the [Derivace f řádu n (n-tá derivace)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/derivace-f-du-n-n-t-derivace) recursively. The 0-th derivative is simply the function itself ($f^{(0)} = f$), and the $n$-th derivative is the derivative of the $(n-1)$-th derivative, formalized as $f^{(n)} = \left(f^{(n-1)}\right)'$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This provides a systematic way to determine higher-order derivatives of a function.

A significant theorem introduced was the [Taylorova věta](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/taylorova-v-ta), which states that if a function $f$ has continuous derivatives up to order $n \ge 0$ on $(a, x)$ and $f^{(n+1)}$ exists in every point of $(a, x)$, then $f(x)$ can be expressed as a [Taylorův polynom f v a řádu n (T_n(x))](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/taylor-v-polynom-f-v-a-du-n-t_n-x)$ plus a [Zbytek v Lagrangeově tvaru](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/zbytek-v-lagrangeov-tvaru). The formula for Taylor's Theorem is:
$$f(x) = f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \dots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n + \frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$$
Here, $c$ is a value between $a$ and $x$. This theorem is crucial for approximating functions, as illustrated by approximations of sine and cosine functions around $x=0$.

The discussion then shifted to properties of functions related to their derivatives, starting with [Monotonie funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/monotonie-funkce). A key theorem establishes that if $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ and its first derivative $f'(x) > 0$ within $I$, then $f$ is increasing on $I$. Conversely, if $f'(x) < 0$, it is decreasing. This principle extends to non-decreasing and non-increasing functions based on non-strict inequalities for the derivative.

Further exploration involved identifying [Lokální minimum (maximum)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/lok-ln-minimum-maximum) points, which are values $f(a)$ where $f(x) \ge f(a)$ (for minimum) or $f(x) \le f(a)$ (for maximum) in some punctured neighborhood of $a$. A critical insight is that if a function $f$ has a local extremum at a point $a$, then either $f'(a) = 0$ (making $a$ a [Stacionární bod](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/stacion-rn-bod)) or $f'(a)$ does not exist (as seen in functions with sharp turns like $|x|$ or piecewise functions). The second derivative test helps classify these stationary points: if $f'(a)=0$ and $f''(a) > 0$, then $f$ has a sharp local minimum at $a$; if $f''(a) < 0$, it has a sharp local maximum. It was also noted that a continuous function on a closed interval attains its absolute maximum and minimum either at local extrema or at the endpoints of the interval.

The lecture also covered the geometric properties of functions related to their second derivative: [Konvexní funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/konvexn-funkce) and [Konkávní funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/konk-vn-funkce). A continuous function $f$ on an interval $I$ is convex if $f''(x) \ge 0$ within $I$, and concave if $f''(x) \le 0$. A point where a function transitions from convex to concave or vice versa is called an [Inflexní bod](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/inflexn-bod). For an inflection point at $a$, either $f''(a)$ does not exist or $f''(a)=0$. A sufficient condition for an inflection point is when $f''(a) = 0$ and $f'''(a) \neq 0$.

Lastly, the lecture defined [Asymptota grafu funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/asymptota-grafu-funkce). A vertical asymptote exists at $x=a$ if function $f$ has at least one improper one-sided limit at $a \in \mathbb{R}$. An oblique (or slant) asymptote $y=px+q$ exists at $a \in \{\pm\infty\}$ if $p = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{x}$ and $q = \lim_{x\to a} (f(x)-px)$ both exist. Examples such as $f(x) = x^3-3x^2+3|x|$ and $f(x) = x^2/(x+1)^2$ were used to illustrate how to identify local extrema, sharp points, and asymptotes.

## Sequences and Set Theory Fundamentals

Moving beyond individual functions, the lecture introduced the concept of a [Posloupnost (reálných čísel)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/posloupnost-re-ln-ch-sel) as a mapping from the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ to the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, denoted $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$. A sequence $(a_n)$ has a limit $a \in \mathbb{R}$ ($\lim a_n = a$) if for every neighborhood $U$ of $a$, there exists an $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for all $n > n_0$, $a_n \in U$. A sequence with a finite limit is a [Konvergentní posloupnost](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/konvergentn-posloupnost). It was noted that all convergent sequences are bounded. The lecture also presented a theorem connecting function limits to sequences: $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = b$ if and only if $\lim f(a_n) = b$ for every sequence $(a_n)$ from the function's domain (excluding $a$) that converges to $a$.

Related to sequences, a [Hromadná hodnota posloupnosti](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/hromadn-hodnota-posloupnosti) (accumulation point) $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is a value such that every neighborhood of $a$ contains infinitely many terms of the sequence. An important theorem states that $a$ is an accumulation point if and only if it is the limit of some subsequence. Every sequence has an accumulation point, and if it's bounded, it has a finite accumulation point. The concepts of [Limes superior](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/limes-superior) ($\limsup_{n\to\infty} a_n$) and [Limes inferior](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/limes-inferior) ($\liminf_{n\to\infty} a_n$) were introduced as the largest and smallest accumulation points of the sequence, respectively. For a sequence, having a limit is equivalent to having a single accumulation point, which is also equivalent to its limes superior equaling its limes inferior.

Briefly, the lecture also touched on basic set theory, defining [Mohutnost (kardinalita)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/mohutnost-kardinalita) as the equivalence relation between sets that can be put into bijection. Sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers ($\mathbb{N}$) are called [Spočetné množiny](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/spo-etn-mno-iny). It was stated that rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$) are countable, while real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) are uncountable.

## Fundamental Theorems for Continuous Functions and Function Types

The lecture revisited key theorems concerning continuous functions. Weierstrass's Theorem states that a continuous function on a closed interval attains its maximum and minimum values within that interval. The [Intermediate Value Theorem](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/intermediate-value-theorem-o-mezihodnot) asserts that if a function $f$ is continuous on an interval and takes on values $m < M$, then it takes on all values in the interval $(m, M)$.

Furthermore, the lecture provided a quick review of common function types, including powers ($x^a$, where $a \in \mathbb{R}$), exponential functions ($a^x$ for $a > 0, a \neq 1$, with $e^x$ implicitly discussed), their inverse logarithmic functions ($\log_a x$, especially natural logarithm $\ln x = \log_e x$ and decimal logarithm $\log x = \log_{10} x$), and trigonometric functions ($\sin x$, $\cos x = \sin(x + \pi/2)$, $\tan x = \sin x / \cos x$, $\cot x = \cos x / \sin x$) along with their inverse functions (arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccot). A general definition for functions of the form $f(x)^{g(x)}$ was given as $f(x)^{g(x)} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} e^{g(x) \ln f(x)}$, particularly useful when $g(x)$ is not a rational constant.

## Integral Calculus: Primitive Functions and Indefinite Integrals

The final segment of the lecture introduced the concept of a [Primitivní funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/primitivn-funkce) (antiderivative). A function $F$ is a primitive function of $f$ on an interval $I$ if $F' = f$ on $I$. An important result is that any continuous function on an interval has a primitive function. It was highlighted that while a primitive function always exists for continuous functions, it cannot always be expressed in terms of elementary functions (e.g., the primitive function of $e^{-x^2}$). Furthermore, while primitive functions are always continuous, their derivatives (the original functions) may not be. An example of a function $F(x) = x^2 \sin(1/x)$ for $x \neq 0$ and $F(x) = 0$ for $x = 0$ was presented to illustrate a primitive function whose derivative is not continuous at $x=0$.

Key properties of primitive functions were also stated:
1.  If $F$ is a primitive function of $f$, then $F+c$ (for any constant $c \in \mathbb{R}$) is also a primitive function of $f$.
2.  If $F_1$ and $F_2$ are both primitive functions of $f$ on an interval, then their difference $F_1 - F_2$ is a constant.

The collection of all primitive functions of $f$ on an interval $I$ is defined as the [Neurčitý integrál](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/neur-it-integr-l) of $f$ on $I$, provided this set is non-empty. This concept lays the groundwork for more advanced integral calculus.
