# Mathematical Analysis: Integrals, Series, and Numerical Methods

This lecture provides a comprehensive exploration of fundamental concepts in mathematical analysis, bridging the gap between theoretical constructs and practical applications. It covers essential integral transforms, various applications of definite integrals for geometric calculations, the intricate theory of infinite numerical series, and crucial numerical methods for approximating integrals, culminating in a practical example of error analysis.

## Integral Transforms and Their Definitions

The lecture began by introducing two significant integral transforms. First, the [Laplaceova transformace](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/laplaceova-transformace_mc_laplace-transform) is defined for a function $f(t)$ that is piecewise continuous on $(0, +\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ and satisfies the growth condition $|f(t)| \le M e^{at}$. Its definition is given by:

$$F(p) = \int_0^{+\infty} f(t)e^{-pt} dt$$

Here, $F(p)$ represents the Laplace transform of $f(t)$, where $p$ is a complex frequency variable (or $x > 0$ for real $p$).
Following this, the [Gamma funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/gamma-funkce_mc_gamma-function-γx) was presented as an extension of the factorial function to complex numbers. It is defined for $x > 0$ by the integral:

$$\Gamma(x) = \int_0^{+\infty} t^{x-1}e^{-t} dt$$

## Applications of Definite Integrals in Geometry

The lecture then transitioned to demonstrating the versatility of definite integrals in calculating various geometric properties. A core concept introduced was the [Střední hodnota funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/st-edn-hodnota-f-mean-value-of-f). For a function $f$ on an interval $(a, b)$, its mean value is defined as:

$$\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x)dx$$

This definition is valid provided the integral converges. A key theorem highlighted that a continuous function on a closed interval will always attain its mean value.

Beyond mean values, integrals are instrumental in calculating areas and lengths. The [Obsah plochy mezi křivkami](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/obsah-plochy-mezi-k-ivkami) for two piecewise continuous functions $f \le g$ on $(a, b)$ is given by the integral:

$$\int_a^b (g(x)-f(x)) dx$$

Furthermore, the lecture covered how to determine the [Délka grafu funkce](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/délka-grafu-funkce-(Arc-length)). For a function $f$ with a piecewise continuous derivative on $(a, b)$, the arc length of its graph is found using:

$$\int_a^b \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2} dx$$

The utility of integrals extends to three-dimensional geometry as well. The [Objem rotačního tělesa](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/objem-rota-n-ho-t-lesa), formed by rotating a piecewise continuous function $f$ on $(a, b)$ around the x-axis (disk method), is calculated as:

$$\pi \int_a^b f^2(x) dx$$

Finally, the [Obsah rotační plochy](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/obsah-rota-n-plochy), generated by rotating the graph of $f$ (with a piecewise continuous derivative) around the x-axis, is given by:

$$2\pi \int_a^b f(x) \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2} dx$$

## Theory of Infinite Numerical Series

A significant portion of the lecture was dedicated to the [Nekonečná číselná řada](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/nekone-n-seln-ada-infinite-numerical-series), expressed as $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k = a_1 + a_2 + \dots$, where $(a_k)$ is a sequence of numbers. The lecture clarified the concepts of the $k$-th term, the [n-tý částečný součet](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/n-t-ste-n-sou-et-n-th-partial-sum) ($s_n = a_1 + \dots + a_n$), and the sum of the series as the limit of its partial sums. A series can exhibit three behaviors: it [konvergence řady](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/konvergence-ady-series-convergence) (has a finite sum), [divergence řady](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/divergence-ady-series-divergence) (has an infinite sum), or [oscilace řady](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/oscilace-ady-series-oscillation) (has no sum).

The lecture particularly highlighted the [Geometrická řada](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/geometrick-ada-geometric-series), defined as $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_1q^{k-1} = a_1+a_1q+a_1q^2+\dots$. A crucial theorem states that this series converges to $\frac{a_1}{1-q}$ if $|q|<1$, but does not converge if $|q| \ge 1$ and $a_1 \ne 0$. Basic properties of series, such as linearity ($\sum(a_k+b_k) = \sum a_k + \sum b_k$ and $\sum ca_k = c\sum a_k$), were also discussed. A fundamental concept, the [Nutná podmínka konvergence řady](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/nutn-podm-nka-konvergence-ady), stipulates that if $\sum a_k$ converges, then $\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0$. It was also noted that a series with non-negative terms always has a sum (which is $\ge 0$).

## Series Convergence Tests

To determine the convergence behavior of series, several tests were introduced:
*   The [Srovnávací kritérium (Comparison test)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/srovn-vac-krit-rium-comparison-test) states that for series $\sum a_k, \sum b_k$ with $0 \le a_k \le b_k$: if $\sum b_k$ converges, then $\sum a_k$ converges; conversely, if $\sum a_k$ diverges, then $\sum b_k$ diverges.
*   The concept of [Absolutní konvergence](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/absolutn-konvergence) was defined: a series $\sum a_k$ is [absolutně konvergentní řada](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/absolutn-konvergentn-ada-absolutely-convergent-series) if $\sum |a_k|$ converges. A vital theorem confirms that an absolutely convergent series always converges.
*   The [Podílové kritérium (Ratio test)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/pod-lov-krit-rium-ratio-test) for $\sum a_k$ (where $a_k \ne 0$) states:
    *   If $\left|\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right| \le q < 1$, the series converges absolutely.
    *   If $\left|\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right| \ge 1$, it does not converge.
    Its limit form is particularly useful: if $\lim_{k\to\infty} \left|\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right| < 1$, it converges absolutely; if $> 1$, it does not converge.
*   The [Odmocninové kritérium (Root test)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/odmocninov-krit-rium-root-test) offers an alternative, replacing $\left|\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\right|$ with $\sqrt[k]{|a_k|}$.
*   The [Integrální kritérium (Integral test)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/integr-ln-krit-rium-integral-test) provides a powerful link between series and improper integrals: if $f$ is a non-increasing function on $(k_0, +\infty)$ and $f(k) = |a_k|$, then $\sum a_k$ converges absolutely if and only if $\int_{k_0}^{\infty} f(x)dx$ converges.
*   For alternating series, the [Leibnizovo kritérium (Alternating Series Test)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/leibnizovo-krit-rium-alternating-series-test) states that if $(b_k)$ is a non-increasing sequence with a zero limit, then $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k-1} b_k$ converges.
*   Finally, the lecture touched upon [Přerovnání řady (Rearrangement of series)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/p-erovn-n-ady-rearrangement-of-series), defining it as $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_{f(k)}$ where $f$ is a bijection on $\mathbb{N}$. A crucial property is that if a series converges absolutely, any rearrangement also converges absolutely and to the same sum. Consequently, splitting an absolutely convergent series into finitely many rearranged parts does not alter its sum.

## Numerical Integration Techniques

The latter part of the lecture focused on practical numerical methods for approximating definite integrals. The discussion began with [Gaussova metoda (Gaussian Quadrature)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/gaussova-metoda-gaussian-quadrature), which stands out for its optimal choice of nodes and weights, resulting in a higher order of approximation (twice the number of nodes).

Subsequently, the family of [Newtonovy-Cotesovy metody](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/newtonovy-cotesovy-metody) was introduced. These methods rely on an equidistant partitioning of the integration interval $(a, b)$ and optimal weights. They are categorized as either closed (considering endpoints $a, b$) or open (excluding them). Specific methods within this family include:
*   The [Obdélníková metoda (Midpoint Rule)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/obd-ln-kov-metoda-midpoint-rule), which approximates the integral by using the functional value at the midpoint of each subinterval.
*   The [Lichoběžníková metoda (Trapezoidal Rule)](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/lichob-n-kov-metoda-trapezoidal-rule), which approximates the area under the curve by integrating linear interpolations (forming trapezoids).
*   [Simpsonova metoda](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/simpsonova-metoda), a more advanced technique that approximates the area using parabolic interpolation over pairs of subintervals. For this method, $I = \int_a^b f(x)dx$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}$, step size $h = (b-a)/n$, and points $x_i = a + ih$.

Finally, the lecture presented [Richardsonova extrapolace](https://felwiki.basta.one/en/Concepts/richardsonova-extrapolace), a powerful technique used to improve the accuracy of approximate results obtained from numerical methods. This is based on the error expansion formula:

$$F(h) = F(0)+ah^p+O(h^q)$$

where $F(h)$ is the approximation with step size $h$, $F(0)$ is the exact value, $a$ is a constant, $p$ is the order of the dominant error term, and $O(h^q)$ represents higher-order error terms, with $q > p$. The lecture concluded with a practical example involving the numerical integration of a standard normal distribution probability density function, $\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} dx$, demonstrating the required precision and discussing the number of divisions needed for various methods.
